## Newsletter

The newsletter is published weekly, on Wednesdays, around 15:00 UTC. Typically a
pull request for the newsletter is opened the Saturday before publishing. Any
review of the newsletter PRs is appreciated. However, feedback received after
Tuesday UTC may not be incorporated due to time constraints.

## Compatibility Data

The compatibility section of the website is built from
[YAML](https://yaml.org/) files located in [_data/compatibility/](_data/compatibility/).
The compatibility images (usability screenshots, logos) are located in
[img/compatibility/](img/compatibility/) with sub-folders for each
wallet or service. These files are free for anyone to repurpose/republish
elsewhere.

We welcome pull requests to the compatibility section of the site, including
testing the latest versions of previously tested services/wallets, adding notable
usability screenshots, or adding new service/wallet tests.

When contributing changes to the compatibility data files, review and adhere to
the YAML schema located in [_data/schemas/compatibility.yaml](_data/schemas/compatibility.yaml).

If you believe any of the data in the compatibility section is incorrect, you
can also [submit an issue](../../issues/) detailing what is wrong and how to correct it.

If you want to request a new service or wallet be evaluated, or a new test that you
think is useful, please also submit an issue.
