- Script (when referring to the Bitcoin scripting language)
  - use script (no capitalization) when referring to an individual script

  "set foo to True").
  - use whatever capitalization is appropriate when used in code (eg
    "set `foo=true`")

### Spelling

The author of the document gets to choose its flavor of English (e.g.
American or British).  However, the following terms should always be
spelled the same.

| Use | Don't use | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| adaptor signatures | adapter signatures | |
| discreet log contracts | discrete<!-- --> log contracts | Remembering to spell this correctly more often than one time in ten is known as the discrete log problem |
| k-of-n multisig and n-of-n multisignature | m-of-n multisig or any_other_letter-of-any_other_letter multisig | When spoken, 'm-of-n' can easily be confused with 'n-of-n' |
| light client | lite client | |
| merklized | merkelized or merkleized | |

### Preferred terms

| Use | Don't use | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| coinbase transaction | generation transaction | |
| hardware signers _or_ hardware signing devices| hardware wallets | The wallet is the software/logical component that tracks UTXOs, constructs transactions, etc. Devices sold as "hardware wallets" are dedicated key storage and signing devices. |
| forwarding | routing | For relaying LN payments from one node to the next |
| lowercase words for P2P message types e.g. inv, getdata, tx | Uppercase words e.g. INV, GETDATA, TX | The command type contained in the P2P message is lowercase ascii |
| Merklized Alternative Script Trees | Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees | https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2018/12/28/#fn:fn-mast |
| pathfinding | routing | For finding LN routes; *routing* is ok in specialized contexts (e.g. "source-routed" or trampoline routing)
| payjoin | P2EP, bustapay, PayJoin | |
| receiver | recipient | |
| spender | sender | "sender" may ambiguously refer to the sender of data |
| uneconomical output | dust | The dust limit is the minimum value an output must contain in order for Bitcoin Core to relay a transaction containing that output. What's economical or not changes as minimum feerates change, but the dust limit doesn't change often. |

### Units

- **Currency:** acceptable units and abbreviations are:

    | Unit | Abbreviations | Value | &nbsp; |
    |-|-|-|-|
    | bitcoins | **BTC** | |
    | millibitcoins | mBTC | 0.001 BTC | 1e-3 BTC |
    | microbitcoins | ÂµBTC, uBTC | 0.000001 BTC | 1e-6 BTC |
    | satoshis | **sat** | 0.00000001 BTC | 1e-8 BTC |
    | nanobitcoins | nBTC | 0.000000001 BTC | 1e-9 BTC |
    | millisatoshis | msat | 0.00000000001 BTC | 1e-11 BTC |
    | picobitcoins | pBTC | 0.000000000001 BTC | 1e-12 BTC |

    The abbreviations bolded above may always be used without
    introduction; we encourage introduction of other abbreviations, e.g.
    "you can send 1 millisatoshi (msat) on LN".

    The pluralization and agreement rules for bitcoin/bitcoins,
    satoshi/satoshis, and derived units are the same as for
    dollar/dollars (USD).  Similarly, abbreviations are never
    pluralized.

- **Feerates:** the preferred unit is "sat/vbyte" (satoshis per vbyte).
  When used only sporadically within a page or section, it is preferred
  to write out "sat/vbyte" each time, but when used frequently, you may
  introduce and use the abbreviation "sat/vB".  See note in
  *weight/vbytes* item about using SI prefixes.

- **Weight/vbytes:** use vbytes rather than weight units, unless using weight
  units would significantly improve conciseness or comprehensibility.
  You may use fractional vbytes, but consider adding a note that
  production uses of vbytes require they be rounded up.  When using SI
  prefixes with vbytes, introduce the unit the first time it is used,
  e.g. "...BTC per 1,000 vbytes (BTC/kvB)...".

- **Formatting:** follow [SI rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#Unit_symbols_and_numbers)
  for placing a space between a number and its unit of measurement, e.g.
  "1 sat/vB" or "20 MB" are acceptable.  Exception: percentages, e.g.
  "50%" is acceptable.
