The first letter of a proper noun is always capitalized.

- Bitcoin (the network)
- MuSig (the pubkey and signature aggregation scheme. Don't refer to Musig, muSig or musig)
- Script (when referring to the Bitcoin scripting language)
  - use script (no capitalization) when referring to an indvidual script

  "set foo to True").
  - use whatever capitalization is appropriate when used in code (eg
    "set `foo=true`")

### Spelling

The author of the document gets to choose its flavor of English (e.g.
American or British).  However, the following terms should always be
spelled the same.

|-|-|-|
| adaptor signatures | adapter signatures | |
| k-of-n multisig and n-of-n multisignature | m-of-n multisig or any_other_letter-of-any_other_letter multisig | When spoken, 'm-of-n' can easily be confused with 'n-of-n' |

| merklized | merkelized or merkleized | |

### Preferred terms

| Use | Don't use | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| coinbase transaction | generation transaction | |

## Units

- **Currency:** all amounts should be denominated in BTC.  E.g. "the
  default minimum relay fee is 0.00000001 BTC/vbyte".  When writing out
  the name of the currency, pluralize by appending an `s`.  E.g. "Alice
  owns several bitcoins" not ~~"Alice owns several bitcoin"~~.

- **Weight:** use vbytes rather than weight units, unless using weight
  units would significantly improve conciseness or comprehensibility.
  You may use fractional vbytes, but consider adding a note that
  production uses of vbytes require they be rounded up.
