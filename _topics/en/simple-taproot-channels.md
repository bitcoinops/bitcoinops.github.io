excerpt: >
  **Simple taproot channels** are LND funding and commitment
  transactions that use taproot (P2TR) with support for MuSig2
  scriptless multisignature signing when both parties are cooperating.
  This reduces transaction weight space and improves privacy when
  channels are closed cooperatively.

The initial experimental deployment of simple taproot channels in LND
continues to exclusively use [HTLCs][topic htlc], allowing payments
starting in a taproot channel to continue to be forwarded through other
LN nodes that donâ€™t support taproot channels.  Later upgrades of simple
taproot channels, or alternative approaches, may begin supporting
[PTLCs][topic ptlc].
