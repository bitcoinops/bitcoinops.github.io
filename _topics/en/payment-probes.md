excerpt: >
  **Payment probes** are packets designed to discover information about
  the LN channels they travel through, such as whether the channel can
  currently handle a payment of a certain size or how many bitcoins are
  allocated to each participant in the channel.  Probes use the regular
  payment (HTLC) mechanism but are designed to always fail, preventing
  any funds from being transfered.  Probing can be useful, but it can
  also reduce user privacy.
