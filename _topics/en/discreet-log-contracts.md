excerpt: >
  **Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs)** are a contract protocol where two or
  more parties agree to exchange money dependent on the outcome of a
  certain event as determined by an oracle (or several oracles). After
  the event happens, the oracle publishes a commitment to the outcome of
  the event that the winning party can use to claim their funds. The
  oracle doesnâ€™t need to know the terms of the contract (or even that
  a contract was made).

## Optional.  Produces a Markdown link with either "[title][]" or
## "[title](link)"

The transactions creating and settling the contract can be made
indistinguishable from many other Bitcoin transactions or they can be
executed within an LN channel. This makes DLCs more private and
efficient than other known oracle-based contract methods.
Additionally, DLCs are arguably more secure than earlier oracle-based
methods because an oracle that commits to a false result
generates clear evidence of fraud.

The original DLC construction was specific to [schnorr
signatures][topic schnorr signatures].  Later, a version was developed
to use [signature adaptors][topic adaptor signatures] that are
compatible with Bitcoin's existing ECDSA signature scheme.

**Note on spelling:** the name is a play on the *discrete* log
problem, which gives the protocol its [security][dlp], and DLC's
enhanced privacy making the contracts more *discreet*.  The spelling
used by the idea's original author and the DLC interoperability
specification is *discreet log contracts*.
