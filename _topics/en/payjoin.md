excerpt: >
  **Payjoin** is a technique for paying someone while including one of
  their inputs in the payment in order to enhance the privacy of the
  spender, the receiver, and Bitcoin users in general.  The general idea
  is also known under the names Pay-to-EndPoint (P2EP) and Bustapay.

## Optional.  Use Markdown formatting.  Multiple paragraphs.  Links allowed.
