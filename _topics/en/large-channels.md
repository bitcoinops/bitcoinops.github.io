extended_summary: |
  During the early development of LN, developers [agreed][russell why
  limit] to temporarily limit the maximum size of channels to less than
  2<sup>24</sup> base units (0.16777216 BTC; about $40 at the time) and
  individual payments to 2<sup>32</sup> msat (0.04294967296 BTC; about
  $10 at the time).  The goal was to limit the amount any individual
  early adopter would lose due to bugs in the software:

  > better at night knowing that, if you lose money because of my bug, I

  After several years of LN development, the [2018 LN specification
  meeting][] decided to allow implementations to opt-in to [wumbo][]
  (jumbo) channel sizes with no protocol-level amount limit, although
  implementations and users can still refuse to accept channels over
  a customizable size.  Support for this new feature, later named
  `option_support_large_channel` saw widespread implementation among LN
  software in 2020.

  The limit of approximately 0.04 BTC per payment still remains part of
  the LN protocol specification, but [multipath payments][topic
  multipath payments] allow splitting a payment amount above the limit
  into several smaller parts that are each below the limit, making it
  possible for any compatible software to optionally send or receive
  payments above the limit.
