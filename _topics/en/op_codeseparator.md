excerpt: >
  **OP_CODESEPARATOR** is an opcode that changes what data is used when
  a signature commits to a script.  The opcode has been available since
  the original version of Bitcoin Script, but its use and behavior have
  changed over time (with further changes having been proposed).

extended_summary: |
  In Bitcoin 0.1, the scriptSig from a spend and the scriptPubKey of the
  output being spent
  were evaluated together with a [virtual][virtual codesep]
  `OP_CODESEPARATOR` placed between them.  For example, using a P2PK
  script:

      <signature> OP_CODESEPARATOR <public key> OP_CHECKSIG

  In legacy Bitcoin Script, such as the above example,
  `OP_CODESEPARATOR` removes itself and any preceding parts of a script
  from the *scriptCode*---which is part of the data that is hashed to
  create the message that is signed by a signature in Bitcoin.  The
  above code separator allows the signature to only commit to the
  `<pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG` part of the script.  Some operation of this
  type is required because the signature can't commit to
  itself---although Bitcoin 0.1 also directly removed any signatures
  from the commitment using a function named `FindAndDelete()`.

  There's [speculation][todd speculation] that the code separator was
  also part of an earlier Bitcoin design that could have allowed coin
  delegation.  For example, Alice owns a coin but adds Bob to the set of
  people who can spend it---without Alice giving away her private key or
  creating an onchain transaction.  Bob can then delegate further by
  adding Carol to the set of allowed spenders.  No released version of
  Bitcoin supported this capability but source code claimed to be from
  a pre-release version of Bitcoin [may][pre todd1] have [supported][pre
  todd2] this capability.

  In [Bitcoin 0.3.7][] (July 2010), one of the fixes related to the [1 OP_RETURN][] bug was
  deployed that
  changed how the scripts were evaluated, including discontinuing the
  use of the virtual `OP_CODESEPARATOR`.  However, the opcode itself
  wasn't changed and scripts have continued to be able to include it
  directly.

  ### Later changes and proposals

  The [BIP143][] signature verification rules for
  version 0 (v0) segwit that activated in August 2017 specified a slightly different
  version of `OP_CODESEPARATOR`.  In legacy script, the
  `FindAndDelete()` operation is used to delete all code separators from
  the scriptCode.  In segwit v0, the `FindAndDelete()` operation is
  no longer performed, so any `OP_CODESEPARATOR` opcodes that appear
  later in script than the most recently executed code separator will be
  included in the scriptCode.  Otherwise, the opcode operates the same
  by deleting its calling `OP_CODESEPARATOR` and any preceding parts of
  the script from the scriptCode.

  As of this writing, the proposed [tapscript][topic tapscript] soft
  fork to implement v1 segwit script contains a further modified
  `OP_CODESEPARATOR`.  In tapscript, signatures no longer commit to a
  computed scriptCode; instead they indirectly commit to the executed
  script through its leaf in the [taproot][topic taproot] merkle tree
  (called the tapleaf).  This would render `OP_CODESEPARATOR` useless, so
  in tapscript signatures must instead commit to the position of the
  most recently executed `OP_CODESEPARATOR` (or 0xffffffff if none has
  been executed).

  Also as of this writing, the proposed [consensus cleanup][topic
  consensus cleanup] soft fork specifies disabling the ability to use
  `OP_CODESEPARATOR` in legacy Bitcoin scripts.  This would prevent it
  from being used to call the relatively slow `FindAndDelete()`
  operation an excessive number of times, a problem known to result in
  transactions and blocks that could take a long time to verify.  This
  proposed change would make unspendable any money spent to a script
  using code separator, so this proposed change met with some
  [criticism][o'connor spendability] even though no one is known to be
  using legacy `OP_CODESEPARATOR`.  It's unclear whether or not this
  part of the proposal may be changed.

  Additionally, Bitcoin Core 0.16.1 and later will not relay or mine any
  transaction that uses `OP_CODESEPARATOR` in a legacy script.
