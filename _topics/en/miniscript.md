excerpt: >
  **Miniscript** allows software to automatically analyze a script,
  including determining what witness data must be generated in order to spend bitcoins
  protected by that script.  With miniscript telling the wallet what it needs to do,
  wallet developers don't need to write new code when they switch from
  one script template to another.

## Optional.  Use Markdown formatting.  Multiple paragraphs.  Links allowed.
extended_summary: |
  The structured representation of Bitcoin scripts provided by
  miniscript allows wallets to be much more dynamic about the scripts they use.
  In support
  of that dynamism, miniscripts can be created using an easily-written
  policy language.  Policies are composable, allowing any valid
  sub-expression to be replaced by another valid sub-expression (within
  certain limits imposed by the Bitcoin system).

## Optional.  Produces a Markdown link with either "[title][]" or
## "[title](link)"

## Optional.  Each entry requires "title", "url", and "date".  May also use "feature:
## true" to bold entry
