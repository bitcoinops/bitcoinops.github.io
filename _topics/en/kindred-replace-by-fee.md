excerpt: >
  **Kindred replace by fee** is the ability for a transaction to replace
  a related transaction in the mempool even if thereâ€™s no conflict
  between the two transactions.  The main form of it is **sibling
  eviction**, where one child of an unconfirmed transaction can replace
  a different child.
