  Although many users find block explorers to be a convenient way to
  look up information about their own transactions, their searches may
  be logged and used to associate their transactions with their IP
  address, browser cookies, and other identifying information.  The
  large indexes block explorers keep also aren't expected to scale well
  as the size and complexity of the block chain grows.
