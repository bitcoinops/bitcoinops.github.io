excerpt: >
  **Attributable failures** are LN payment forwarding failures or delays
  that can be attributed to a pair of nodes (who may have one or more
  channels between each other), allowing spenders to avoid using slow or
  failure-prone nodes for future payments.  Additional fields in LN
  messages for tracking failures and delays are in the process of being
  standardized as of 2025.
