excerpt: >
  **Probabilistic payments** are outputs that allow a pseudorandom
  function to decide which of _n_ parties will be able to spend the funds.

For example, Alice and Bob each deposit 1 BTC into a contract that pays
one of them the full amount based on the result of a cryptographically fair
coin flip.

A particular focus of attention for probabilistic payments in Bitcoin is
for trustless micropayments.  For example, Alice wants to pay Bob 1 sat,
but that would be [uneconomical][topic uneconomical outputs] because it
will cost several hundred sats for Alice to create the payment and for
Bob to later spend it.  Instead, Alice offers Bob 10,000 sats with a
0.01% probability.  On average, that's equivalent to him receiving 1
sat.

Probabilistic micropayments have been proposed as an alternative for
[trimmed HTLCs][topic trimmed htlc].
