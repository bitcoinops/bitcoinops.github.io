excerpt: >
  **MATT** is a soft fork proposal that would add an `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY`
  opcode to Bitcoin's script language and make some other changes that
  would allow limited transaction introspection.  This could allow
  verification of arbitrary programs in contract protocols plus
  support the implementation of several covenant-based features.
