Different node software can use different RBF rules, so there have
been several variations.  The most widely-used form of RBF today is
[BIP125][] **opt-in RBF** as
implemented in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][core12 rbf] and subsequent
versions; this allows the creator of a transaction to signal that
they're willing to allow it to be replaced by a higher-paying version.
An alternative form of RBF is **full-RBF** that allows any transaction to
be replaced whether or not it signals BIP125 replaceability.

BIP125 requires a replacement transaction to pay both higher feerate
(BTC/vbyte) and a higher absolute fee (total BTC).  This can make
multiparty transactions that want to use RBF vulnerable to
[transaction pinning][] attacks, and so an occasional discussion
topic is proposals to allow RBF to operate solely on a feerate basis.
