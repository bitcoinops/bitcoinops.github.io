  **Channel jamming attacks** are Denial of Service (DoS) attacks where
  an attacker can prevent a series of channels up to 20 hops away from
  being able to use part or all of their funds for a prolonged period of
  time.

An LN node can route a payment to itself across a path of 20 or more
hops. This creates two possible avenues for channel jamming attacks:

- *Liquidity jamming attack* (originally called the [loop attack][russell
  loop] in 2015) is where an attacker with `x` amount of money (e.g. 1 BTC) sends
  it to themselves across 20 other channels but delays either settling
  or rejecting the payment, temporarily locking up a total of `20x`
  funds belonging to other users (e.g. 20 BTC). After several hours of locking other
  users' money, the attacker can cancel the payment and receive a
  complete refund on their fees, making the attack essentially free.

- *HTLC jamming attack* is where an attacker sends 483 small payments
  ([HTLCs][topic HTLC]) through the series of 20 channels, where 483
  is the maximum number of pending payments a channel may contain. In
  this case, an attacker with two channels, each with 483 slots, can
  jam over 10,000 honest HTLC slotsâ€”again without paying any fees.

A variety of possible solutions have been
discussed, including *forward upfront fees* paid from the spender to
each node along the path, [backwards upfront fees][news86 backwards
upfront] paid from each payment hop to the previous hop, a
[combination][news122 bidir fees] of both forward and backwards fees,
[nested incremental routing][news119 nested routing], and [fidelity
bonds][news126 routing fibonds].  As of April 2021, no solution has
gained widespread support and developers continue to discuss the issue.
