excerpt: >
  **Version 3 transaction relay** is a proposal to allow transactions
  to opt-in to a modified set of transaction relay policies designed to
  prevent pinning attacks. Combined with package relay, these policies help enable
  the use of dynamic feerates with LN onchain transactions.

## Optional.  Produces a Markdown link with either "[title][]" or
## "[title](link)"

V3 transaction relay is a superset of standard transaction policy.
That is, v3 transactions follow all rules for standard transactions
(e.g. minimum and maximum transaction weights) while also adding some
additional rules designed to allow [transaction replacement][topic rbf]
while precluding transaction-pinning attacks. v3 transactions also
require minor changes to the [package RBF][topic package relay] policy in order to maintain
incentive compatibility with miners.

V3 transaction relay solves rule 3 [transaction pinning][topic transaction pinning]
and may allow the removal of the [CPFP carve-out][topic cpfp carve out].

Version 3 transactions are used by [ephemeral anchors][topic ephemeral anchors].
