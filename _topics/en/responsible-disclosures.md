excerpt: >
  **Responsible disclosures** were occasions when someone discovered a
  vulnerability in Bitcoin-related software and reported it to
  developers, affected users, and the public in a way that helped
  minimize harm.

This page lists occasions when Optech reported on a responsible
disclosure and makes a best-effort attempt to cite the names of the
people who made the disclosure.  There are many other responsible
disclosures not listed here, including those which have not been
