excerpt: >
  **Soft fork activation** describes the moment when a Bitcoin full
  node begins to enforce one or more additional consensus rules.
  These transitions introduce a coordination risk between nodes on the network, so developers have devoted much
  effort over the years to creating and improving soft fork activation
  mechanisms that can minimize the chance a problem will occur.

Soft forks allow the overall network to transition to new consensus
rules even if not every node has adopted those rules.  However,
anytime different nodes enforce different rules, there's a risk that
blocks violating the nonuniform rules will be accepted by some nodes
and rejected by other nodes, causing a consensus failure (chain split)
that can result in double spends of confirmed transactions and a loss
of confidence in the safety of the Bitcoin system.  This is the main
problem that activation mechanisms attempt to mitigate.

### History

Proposals for new soft fork activation mechanisms are often designed
to avoid problems experienced during previous soft forks, so this
section attempts to provide an overview of notable past activation attempts.

#### [2009] Hardcoded height: consensus nLockTime enforcement

The [earliest known][earliest sf] soft fork was implemented in Bitcoin
0.1.6 (released November 2009) and was hardcoded to activate at block
31,000, which occurred on 22 December 2009.  This *hardcoded height*
activation mechanism was used for at least one [other][block size sf]
early soft fork when most development was done by Satoshi Nakamoto.

#### [2011] Hardcoded time and manual intervention: the BIP12 `OP_EVAL` failure

After Nakamoto left development, the first soft forking code merged
into Bitcoin was [BIP12][] `OP_EVAL`.   This planned to use a
combination of a *hardcoded time* activation method and manual
intervention if less than 50% of the network hashrate was prepared to
enforce the change.  Quoting from BIP12:

> [...] new clients and miners will be coded to interpret OP_EVAL as a
> no-op until February 1, 2012. Before then, miners will be asked to
> put the string "OP_EVAL" in blocks that they produce so that hashing
> power that supports the new opcode can be gauged. If less than 50%
> of miners accept the change as of January 15, 2012 the rollout will
> be postponed until more than 50% of hashing power supports OP_EVAL
> (the rollout will be rejected if it becomes clear that a majority of
> hashing power will not be achieved).

The manual intervention may have been needed in this case as a
[serious vulnerability][oconnor recursion] in `OP_EVAL` was discovered
after the activation code was merged but before it was released.
Although that specific bug was [fixed][vanderlaan fix], some
developers feared that there might be additional problems with such a
powerful new opcode and the soft fork attempt was abandoned.

#### [2012] Hardcoded time and manual intervention tried again: BIP16 P2SH

Several simplified replacements for `OP_EVAL` were then proposed (see
BIPs [13][BIP13]/[16][BIP16], [17][BIP17], [18][BIP18], and
[19][BIP19], among [other ideas][maxwell half dozen]), with BIPs 13/16
Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) [gaining the most traction][p2sh votes]
among developers.  P2SH [used][7bf8b7c] the same activation mechanism
as `OP_EVAL`.  The first planned activation was 1 March 2012, but by
the February 15th polling date, fewer than half of the last 1,000
blocks had indicated their miners were ready to enforce the BIP16
rules by March.  This [led][bitcoin core #925] to a "fairly long
alternative chain fork" (chain split) where miners still enforcing
the March 1st start date rejected blocks by the majority of miners not
enforcing those rules.  A second poll of the thousand most recent
blocks occurred on March 15th; this had sufficient support and so
developers released [Bitcoin 0.6.0][] on March 30th with an activation
date of April 1st.

#### [2012] Hardcoded time: BIP30 rejecting duplicate txids

As P2SH activation was being worked on, it was discovered that
multiple transactions could be created with the same txid.  By itself,
this bug would only destroy the funds of a user who attempted to
exploit it, but it could be combined with an oddity in Bitcoin's
merkle tree construction to break consensus between nodes (see
[CVE-2012-2459][]).  The first soft fork fix for this was [BIP30][],
which simply marked as invalid transactions with the same txid as
another transaction with an unspent output.  The fix was
non-controversial among the development team and was [activated][bip30
commit] by a simple hardcoded time included in the same [Bitcoin
0.6.0][] release that contained P2SH's activation parameters.

#### [2012] IsSuperMajority (ISM): BIP34 coinbase prefixes

Despite BIP30 fixing the immediate problem with duplicate txids,
Bitcoin developers knew they didn't want to have to search an index of
every previous transaction with unspent outputs each time a new
transaction was received, so a second solution was developed that
would eliminate the weakness that made duplicating txids practical.
This was [BIP34][].  For this change, developers used something
similar to the miner signaling method from BIP16 P2SH, but this time
miners who were ready for BIP34 were asked to increment their block
`nVersion` value.  More notably, developers automated enforcement for
the new rules in the Bitcoin code so they could release soft-fork
ready software while still waiting for miners to upgrade.  The rules
from BIP34 were implemented in a function called `IsSuperMajority()`
(ISM), which initially included a [single activation threshold][ism
rule 1] that would start enforcement of BIP34's new consensus rule:

> - 75% rule: If 750 of the last 1,000 blocks are version 2 or
>   greater, reject invalid version 2 blocks.

During development of the PR, it was [decided][andresen rule 2] to add a [second activation
threshold][ism rule 2] that would actually fix the underlying problem
by requiring BIP34 to be used:

> - 95% rule: If 950 of the last 1,000 blocks are version 2 or
>   greater, reject all version 1 blocks.

One known problem with the rule to reject old version blocks was that,
until all miners had upgraded, up to several invalid blocks would be
produced each day (a 5% chance per block assuming exactly 95% of
miners upgraded).  Upgraded nodes that enforced ISM's rules would
reject those blocks, but old nodes and lightweight clients that didn't
know about the rules would accept those blocks.  This made the
network was more reliant than usual on miners refusing to build on
invalid blocks.

#### [2015] ISM and validationless mining: the BIP66 strict DER activation

In September 2014, Pieter Wuille [discovered][strictder disclosure] a
divergence in the way OpenSSL handled DER-encoded signatures on
different platforms.  This could be used, for example, to create a
block that would successfully validate on Linux but fail on
Windows---making it possible for an attacker to create a targeted
chain split.  Wuille and a few other developers privately developed the patch for a soft fork that would ensure all signatures
used the same format.  BIP66 was created for the change and advertised
publicly as a step towards removing Bitcoin's dependency on OpenSSL
(which was an actual goal and was finally [achieved][news78 openssl] in 2019).
After BIP66 gained adequate support from users and
developers---including from many people who didn't know about the
security vulnerability---it was released using the same ISM activation
mechanism as BIP34 used, incrementing the block version to v3 and
requiring all v2 or lower blocks be rejected when the 95% threshold
was reached.

The 75% threshold was reached at block height 359,753.  On 4 July
2015, the 95% threshold was reached at block 363,725 and all nodes
running [Bitcoin Core version 0.10.0][] or later (or a compatible
implementation) began enforcing the new rules.  However, at block
height 363,731, a non-upgraded miner produced a block that didn't
contain the correct block version and so was not valid under the new
ISM activation rules.  Other miners built on top of this invalid block,
ultimately producing a chain with six invalid blocks.  This meant
non-upgraded nodes and many lightweight clients treated the 96
transactions in the first invalid block as having six
confirmations even though they hadn't, at that time, been confirmed even once
in a valid block.  Eventually developers were able to contact pool
operators and get them to manually reset their software to return to
the valid chain.  A second event of this type occurred the next day,
giving transactions three false confirmations.  Happily, all regular
transactions from both the six-block and three-block invalid chains
were later confirmed in valid blocks, meaning that no regular users
lost money.

That initial invalid block at height 363,731 was one of the roughly 5%
of blocks per day that was expected to be invalid for no reason other
than using an old version number.  The chance of the next block being
produced by another non-upgraded miner was also 5%, or a cumulative probability of `5% * 5% = 0.25%`.
Under the premise that 95% of miners had upgraded, the cumulative
probability of six blocks in a row all being produced by outdated
miners was 0.000002%---but it wasn't extraordinarily bad luck that was the
culprit here.  What hadn't been considered was miners performing
*validationless mining,* an efficiency optimization where miners would
build upon the header of a new block before they had finished
receiving and verifying that block.  Although validationless mining
software could easily deal with invalid block versions in theory, that
feature had not been implemented in the software used by the miners
who created the five blocks descended from #363,731.  Eventually,
enough miners improved their validationless mining software or
upgraded their nodes and the accidental chain splits related to the
BIP66 activation stopped occurring.

In response to the problems of these [July 2015 chain forks][],
developers redoubled their efforts on reducing the need for
validationless mining, leading to improvements such as [BIP152][]
compact block relay and the [FIBRE][] software.  Developers also began
working on an improved activation mechanism, which would become the
BIP9 protocol described subsequently.

#### [2015] ISM one last time: the BIP65 `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` activation

A soft fork to add a new `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` (CLTV) opcode to
Bitcoin was proposed prior to the BIP66 strict-DER soft fork but was
delayed by the urgency of fixing the OpenSSL vulnerability.  This
illustrated another one of the weaknesses of the ISM mechanism using
incrementing version numbers---a miner who signals readiness for
the latest proposal (version *n*) also implicitly signals readiness
for all previous proposals (e.g. version *n-1*).  This limited the
ability to use ISM to coordinate multiple upgrades in parallel.

However, despite the problems at the end of BIP66's activation, ISM
was again used to avoid delaying [BIP65][] further.  There were no
activation problems this time.

#### [2016] BIP9 versionbits: the BIP68/112/113 relative locktime activation

A new activation mechanism documented in [BIP9][] was proposed to fix
several of the issues with ISM:

- **Penalizing miners unnecessarily:** when ISM activated and the
  minimum block version was incremented, any miners who failed to
  increment their version would produce invalid blocks even if those
  blocks didn't violate any of the soft fork's other rules.  For
  example, in the block that triggered the 4 July 2015 chain split,
  all the transactions followed the new soft fork rules---the
  only reason miners suffered over $50,000 in losses was that the
  upgrade required a block header contain a `3` and a non-upgraded
  miner used a `2`.

- **Impractical parallelization:** with ISM, developers felt they
  needed to wait for one fork to activate before a second fork could
  be started.

- **Inability to fail:** ISM attempts didn't have expiration dates.
  Once node software was released that waited for the activation
  signal, all nodes from that point needed to continue monitoring for
  that signal until activation occurred.  There was no way to decide
  the soft fork was no longer needed.

- **Unpredictable activation times:** Not knowing the exact activation
  time in advance meant it was difficult for protocol developers,
  merchant system administrators, and mining pool operators to be
  available in the hours shortly after activation occurred in case
  there were any problems that needed a quick response.

BIP9 versionbits attempted to solve these problems by using the block
header version field as a bitfield.  Bits in the field were used for
signaling only---never to reject a block as invalid---and they could
be set in parallel.  Measurements were taken only once every 2,016
blocks, minimizing the window during which a small percentage of
hashrate would need to be lucky to project a false impression of 95%
signaling.  Finally, when the 95% signaling threshold was reached,
there would be a 2,016 block (roughly two week) "lock in" period until
activation occurred to allow people to prepare.  If the signaling
threshold wasn't reached by a timeout date, the attempt ended,
allowing the unused code to be removed from later node software
releases.

This activation method was first used with the soft fork that added
[BIP68][] consensus-enforced sequence numbers, [BIP112][]
`OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`, and [BIP113][] nLockTime enforcement by
median time past.  The fork quickly made it to the locked-in phase,
and then proceeded automatically to activation.

#### [2016-7] BIP9, BIP148, and BIP91: the BIP141/143 segwit activation

The segwit soft fork was released with [BIP9][] activation
parameters.  A few miners quickly began signaling readiness but support
peaked far below the 95% threshold.  Some Bitcoin users felt
miners were illegitimately delaying a useful new feature and went on
to develop the mandatory activation that became [BIP148][].  The final
form of BIP148 specified rejecting any
blocks that didn't signal support for segwit starting on a
certain date.

With the introduction of software implementing BIP148, there were
three sets of nodes on the network---non-upgraded, BIP9/141 nodes, and
BIP148/141 nodes---increasing the number of situations that could end
in consensus failure.  If miners failed to
signal support for segwit, and most users continued to consider those
miners' blocks as valid, users of BIP148 might accept bitcoins that
would be invalid from the perspective of most other Bitcoin users.  Alternatively, if
most users of Bitcoin followed the BIP148 rules---but miners still
produced many BIP148-invalid blocks---those users who didn't enforce
BIP148 could accept bitcoins that the BIP148 users would consider
invalid.  Only if all users followed the same rules, or most mining
hashrate followed the BIP148 rules, would safety be assured.

One way to reduce this risk was to give more users time to upgrade to
a node that would mandate activation of segwit.  BIP148 couldn't do
this since its goal of triggering the existing BIP9 segwit deployment
meant it had to force miner signaling to start long before segwit's
BIP9 timeout date.  As an alternative in case BIP148 failed to gain
sufficient support, [BIP149][] was proposed to give users another year
to upgrade.  BIP149 never gained much public support, but it was the
first proposal to use [BIP8][], which would see additional
discussion in subsequent years.

After BIP148 began receiving significant public support,
several miners, exchanges, and other businesses signed their support
for a two-step proposal that started with activation of segwit in a
way that would remain in consensus with nodes supporting BIP148.  This first stage was proposed
in [BIP91][], which was a modification of the BIP9 rules.  Miners used
a BIP9 versionbit to signal whether they would enforce a temporary
rule to reject any blocks not signaling the BIP141/143 segwit
versionbit.  Compared to BIP9, the BIP91 threshold was reduced from
95% to 80% and its monitoring and lockin period lengths were reduced
from 2,016 blocks to 336 blocks.

BIP91 locked in and activated.
Subsequently, BIP141/143 locked in and activated.  BIP148 mandatory
signaling expired when BIP141/143 locked in.  The second stage of
the proposal from miners, exchanges, and other businesses required a
hard fork; spokespersons for the signers eventually withdrew their
proposal after vocal opposition from a large number of individual
users and several businesses.

It remains a subject of debate exactly how much each of the above
events, and other events occurring around the same time, actually
contributed to segwit being activated.

### Emergency activations

In several cases where a serious vulnerability was found in consensus
code, developers released a fix without any activation conditions.
This risked a consensus failure but it also eliminated the immediate
vulnerability for each node as soon as it upgraded.  Notable
occasions included:

- **Replace height with chainwork (July 2010):** Bitcoin was originally
  implemented to follow the valid chain with the most blocks ("longest
  chain").  If every block had the same difficulty, that would be the
  chain with the most Proof-of-Work (PoW).  But different blocks can
  have different difficulty, so the [chainwork][] soft fork was
  released in [Bitcoin 0.3.3][] to follow the valid chain with the
  greatest cumulative proof of work.

- **Eliminate script bypass bug (July 2010):** Bitcoin originally
  combined the script that spent a UTXO (the scriptSig) with the
  script that secured that UTXO (the scriptPubKey) and evaluated them
  at the same time.  This could allow someone to cause the script to
  terminate in success before its locking mechanism had been evaluated
  (e.g. before running `OP_CHECKSIG` to verify a signature was valid).
  The bug was originally [reported][1 OP_RETURN] as a scriptSig of
  `OP_TRUE OP_RETURN` allowing spending anyone's bitcoins.  Initially
  this was [fixed][op_return always false] in [Bitcoin 0.3.6][] by
  causing the `OP_RETURN` opcode to always result in failure and by
  placing a number of other limits on scripts.  Although all of those
  changes were soft fork changes, the same code revision also made a
  hard forking [change][op_nopx] that would allow removing some of
  those limitations later.  Despite those significant changes, the
  underlying problem of scriptSigs being able to tamper with the
  execution of scriptPubKeys remained and so a [second soft
  fork][split evalscript] implemented in [Bitcoin 0.3.8][] began
  evaluating scriptSigs independently of scriptPubKeys. <!-- technically
  implemented in 0.3.7 according to revision history, but there's no
  release announcement for that which I can find. -->

- **Fix value overflow bug (August 2010):** someone
  created a transaction that spent 0.5 BTC to two outputs worth
  92,233,720,368.54277039 BTC.  Bitcoin requires that the output
  amount be less than or equal to the input amount, but this was
  checked by adding the output values into a single 64-bit
  integer which can only hold a maximum value of
  9,223,372,036,854,776 sats (about 92 billion BTC) before rolling over to negative numbers,
  starting with -9,223,372,036,854,776 sats.  This meant it looked like the
  transaction spent a total of -0.1 BTC (negative 0.1 BTC).  This
  bypassed another rule that forbid individual negative outputs---but
  not negative aggregate amounts---since it assumed the sum of any set
  of positive values would also be positive.  This gave the person who
  created that transaction 184 billion BTC.  The trick could be
  repeated indefinitely at no cost, allowing production of an
  unlimited number of bitcoins.  Within hours, a soft fork
  [fix][overflow fix] restricting outputs to 21 million bitcoins was
  released in [Bitcoin 0.3.10][].  This did require abandoning the
  chain with the overflowed transaction---a deliberate consensus
  failure, but one required to ensure Bitcoin remained useful.

- **Temporarily fix BDB locks issue (March 2013):** in early 2012,
  Bitcoin developers [became aware][bitcoin core #925] that trying to
  make too many changes to the UTXO database (chainstate) at the same
  time could lead to exceeding one of the default capacity limits of
  the chainstate's database.  With the small size of Bitcoin blocks at
  the time, this was only found to occur during block chain
  reorganizations where transactions from multiple blocks were all
  processed at the same time.  A simple [solution][bitcoin core #930]
  was implemented: during a reorganization, only process the
  transactions from a single block at a time.  Later, some people
  began [asking miners][hearn soft limit] to raise the optional
  default block size from 250 kilobytes to something larger.  On 12
  March 2013, one of those miners produced an [almost 1 megabyte
  block][andresen 998,081] with over 1,700 transactions---by far the
  largest block on Bitcoin up to that date---and this was enough to
  exceed the database capacity on many nodes, causing them to consider
  the block invalid even though it followed all of Bitcoin's explicit
  consensus rules.  Complicating the situation, a new version of
  Bitcoin Core had been released which used a different database
  engine that didn't contain this limit, and it accepted the large
  block without problems---producing a consensus failure between the
  two different node versions.  After quickly analyzing the situation,
  developers encouraged users to temporarily downgrade to the old
  version of Bitcoin (the version that rejected the large block) and
  then to upgrade to an [emergency release][bitcoin
  core 0.8.1] that implemented a soft fork with a temporary block
  size limit of 500,000 bytes, which was pre-programmed to expire
  several months later after everyone had a chance to upgrade to the
  new database engine.

### Future activations

After the problems of the segwit activation, several people came to
work on the [BIP8][] proposal that proponents claims resolves several
issues with BIP9:

  - **Allows mandatory activation:** BIP8 began as a generalization of
    BIP148, allowing miners to voluntarily signal for activation for
    most periods of the activation deployment but requiring them to signal during
    the final period or risk creating invalid blocks.  Later, a
    parameter `LockinOnTimeout` (LOT) was created to toggle this
    behavior; nodes using LOT=true will require signaling in the final
    period before the timeout; nodes using LOT=false will not require signaling but will
    still enforce the new rules if enough blocks are signaling.

  - **Heights instead of times:** BIP9 starts and stops monitoring for
    activation signals based on an average of the times encoded by
    miners into recent blocks.  It's possible for miners to manipulate
    these times, which can stymie a LOT=true activation, so the
    BIP8 proposal instead uses block heights.

BIP8's flexibility allowed it to be used to compare a [variety of
activation proposals][] for the proposed [taproot][topic taproot] soft
fork, although detractors have leveled
several criticisms against aspects of it, such as configurations that
[allow miners to refuse activation][dashjr lot=false] of proposals
that have wide community support, configurations that encourage one
group to [co-opt the signaling mechanism][corallo co-opt] used by a different group,
configurations that require miners to make [ineffectual changes to the
blocks][corallo pool side] they produce, configurations that seem to [give developers
authority over consensus rules][harding f7], and configurations that
[increase the risk of consensus failure][towns chain split].  As of
this writing, discussion in the context of taproot activation remains
ongoing.

<!-- "in all possible scenarios, LOT=False puts users and the network at
significant risk." -->
[dashjr lot=false]: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018498.html
<!-- "I'm still incredibly worried about users pushing for some
UASF-style forced-signaling guerilla faster-activation. [...] However,
as we saw with BIP 148/UASF, even a tiny minority of transacting users
can set the tone and claim victory over how a soft-fork activates." -->
[corallo co-opt]: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018595.html
<!-- "With lot=false and lot=true nodes active on the network, a chain
split occurs if the activation is blocked [...] as default scenario
for every consensus change [...] It doesn't seem as focussed on safety
as I'd expect from bitcoin." -->
[towns chain split]: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018723.html
<!-- "As for a "mandatory signaling period" as a part of BIP 8 [...]
in practice, we've seen that version bits are set on the pool side,
and not on the node side, meaning the goal of ensuring miners have
upgraded isn't really accomplished in practice, you just end up
forking the chain for no gain." -->
[corallo pool side]: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-January/017582.html
<!-- "[LOT=true does not prove] that developers don't control changes
to the system." -->

Other activation ideas have also been discussed, including
probabilistic soft fork activation ([sporks][]), multi-stage
("modern") soft fork activation ([MSFA][]), decreasing threshold
activation ([decthresh][]), a return to hardcoded height or time
activations ([flag days][]), and a short signaling period followed by
an activation delay ([speedy trial][]).
