excerpt: >
  **Exfiltration resistant signing** is the process of creating
  signatures for Bitcoin transactions using a protocol that can be
  audited to ensure the signature doesn't contain any biased or
  otherwise manipulated elements that could be used to compromise the
  signer's private keys.
