excerpt: >
  **MuSig** is a protocol for aggregating public keys and signatures for
  the schnorr digital signature algorithm.

## Optional.  Use Markdown formatting.  Multiple paragraphs.  Links allowed.
extended_summary: |
  MuSig allows multiple users each with their own private key to create a
  combined public key that's indistinguishable from any other schnorr
  pubkey, including being the same size as a single-user pubkey.  It
  further describes how the users who created the pubkey can work
  together to securely create a signature corresponding to the pubkey.
  Like the pubkey, the signature is indistinguishable from any
  other schnorr signature.

  Compared to traditional script-based multisig, MuSig uses less block
  space and is more private, but it may also require more interactivity
  between the participants.

## Optional.  Produces a Markdown link with either "[title][]" or
