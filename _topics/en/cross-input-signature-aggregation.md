excerpt: >
  **Cross-input signature aggregation** is a proposal to reduce the
  number of signatures a transaction requires.  In theory, every
  signature required to make a transaction valid could be combined into a
  single signature that covers the whole transaction.

---
For example, Alice controls two [P2TR][topic taproot] UTXOs.  Normally,
if she creates a transaction spending both UTXOs with a keypath spend,
she'll need to include one 16-vbyte signature in each output.  However,
any node could aggregate both public keys from the UTXOs and Alice could
produce a single 16-vbyte [MuSig][topic musig]-style [scriptless
multisigature][topic multisignature] that corresponded to the aggregate
public key, proving that she controlled the private key for both of the
original public keys.

Although inputs would still need to include a significant amount of
other data, such as the 36-vbyte outpoint that uniquely identifies the
UTXO being spent, CISA could provide a modest reduction in the size of
transactions with multiple inputs.  It could make the per-participant
transaction fees for a [coinjoin][topic coinjoin] moderately cheaper than each
participant creating a transaction on their own, which could lead to
more people using coinjoin-style privacy.
