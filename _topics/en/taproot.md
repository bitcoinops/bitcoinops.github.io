Coins protected by taproot may be spent either by satisfying one of
the committed scripts or by simply providing a signature that verifies
against the public key (allowing the script to be kept private).
Taproot is intended for use with schnorr signatures that simplify
multiparty construction (e.g. using [MuSig][topic musig]) and with MAST to
allow committing to more than one script, any one of which may be
used at spend time.
