An optimization included in Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 skipped a check on
newly-received blocks that was thought to be redundant, making the
node willing to partly process blocks that tried to spend the same
input more than once.  This would trigger some code meant to catch
unexpected node operation and cause the node to deliberately crash.
This allowed a denial-of-service attack that could be exploited by
miners.

The code meant to catch unexpected operation (an assert) was rewritten
for Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, unintentionally allowing the node to continue
operation in the case of duplication inputs.  This allowed a miner to
spend the same bitcoins more than once.

The vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed by
developer Awemany on 17 September 2018.  Patches were available within
hours, and a binary release for the current release branch within 36
hours---both only mentioning the DoS vulnerability.  After several
developers reviewing the patch were able to reverse engineer the bug
and discover the inflation risk, a full disclosure was made by Bitcoin
Core developers on 20 September 2018.

The bug was never exploited on Bitcoin mainnet and an overwhelming
majority of full nodes subsequently updated to unaffected versions of
Bitcoin Core.

After the full disclosure, the bug was exploited on Bitcoin testnet,
causing any nodes still running Bitcoin Core 0.14.x to crash and nodes
running 0.15.0 to 0.16.2 to accept a transaction that spent the same
funds more than once.  When testnet miners managed to produce a valid
chain with more proof-of-work than the invalid chain, those
non-upgraded nodes attempted to switch to the new chain but were
unable to fully un-spend a double-spent input.  This left the old
testnet nodes stuck on a lower-proof-of-work block chain, requiring
manual user intervention to fix them.
