excerpt: >
  **X-only public keys** are public keys for the secp256k1 elliptic
  curve that only provide the _x_ coordinate for their position in the
  finite field.  This is in comparison to _uncompressed public keys_ that
  provide both their _x_ and _y_ coordinates and _compressed public
  keys_ that provide their _x_ coordinate plus an additional bit to
  differentiate the two _y_ alternatives.

Bitcoin public keys are points on the secp256k1 elliptic curve over
a 256-bit finite field.  It's easy to describe such a point by giving
its _x_ and _y_ coordinates, using a 256-bit number for each (32 bytes
each, for a total of 64 bytes).  Uncompressed public keys do this,
adding a prefix byte for a total of 65 bytes.

If we describe just the _x_ coordinate and use the curve equation to
derive the _y_ coordinate, we find that each _x_ coordinate corresponds
to two different _y_ coordinates.  This allows us to compact our
description to 256 bits for the _x_ coordinate plus a single extra bit
to indicate which of the _y_ coordinates to use.  Compressed public keys
do this, containing the bit within their prefix byte for a total of 33
bytes.

The extra bit can be eliminated if only one of the two alternative _y_
coordinates is allowed.  X-only public keys do this, using a total of
32 bytes.  Segwit v1 ([taproot][topic taproot]) and the initial version
of [tapscript][topic tapscript] use x-only public keys for all signature
checking operations to reduce the size of public keys.

The advantage of x-only public keys is that they save space.  The
downside is that public keys need to be generated in a way that ensures
they only use the allowed _y_ coordinate.  This is easy for a wallet
generating a public key but it
was later realized that it could be quite challenging for any
[covenant][topic covenants] that needed to modify taproot witness
programs that commit to both a [MAST][topic mast]-like tree of scripts
and an x-only internal public key.
