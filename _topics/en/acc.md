excerpt: >
  **Accountable Computing Contracts (ACC)** are payments
  that the receiving party can spend if they verifiably run a specified
  function on a specified set of inputs.  If the receiving party doesn't
  run the function or doesn't run it correctly, the paying party can
  reclaim the payment after a period of time.

For example, Alice claims she has a solution to a puzzle.  Bob wants to
buy the solution to the puzzle, but Alice is unwilling to give him a
solution until she's guaranteed to receive a payment.  Bob is similarly
unwilling to pay Alice until he's sure the solution is correct.  They
decide to write a program that will return true if it verifies the
solution is correct. Then Bob pays money to a transaction output that
will allow Alice to claim the money if she provides a solution that was
verified by the program.  If the solution is incorrect, either Alice's
spend will be invalid or she will need to pay a penalty that is equal to
or greater than the amount of the payment.

There have been several proposals and implementations of this idea for
Bitcoin:

- [Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments][zkcp] (ZKCPs) allow Alice to
  prove that she ran the program on her puzzle solution and that the
  solution has a particular hash digest.  Bob can then create an
  [HTLC][topic HTLC] that pays Alice if she discloses the preimage for
  that hash digest.  If Alice doesn't disclose it, Bob can reclaim his
  funds after the HTLC timelock expires.

- [BitVM][] allows Bob to deposit money into a contract that
  compactly references the program they're using for verification.
  Alice can then provide the solution.  If Bob is satisfied, he releases
  the money to Alice.  If he fails to take action, Alice can claim the
  money after a period of time.  If he isn't satisfied, he can challenge
  Alice to prove that their program returns true when run on her
  solution, breaking the challenge into multiple steps that each require
  an onchain transaction.  BitVM is available on Bitcoin today.

- [MATT][topic matt] works similar to BitVM, although it requires a soft
  fork.  As a tradeoff, it can be much more efficient than BitVM due to
  changing the consensus rules to make this type of proving
  efficient.
