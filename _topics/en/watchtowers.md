extended_summary: |
  The service provided by watchtowers allows their clients to go offline
  for significant amounts of time without having to worry about their
  funds being stolen by a counterparty.  Watchtowers are not
  entrusted with any funds, just the responsibility of monitoring the
  block chain and broadcasting transactions, although breach remedy
  transactions can be designed so that the watchtower receives a portion
  of the safeguarded funds if their services are needed.

## "[title](link)"
