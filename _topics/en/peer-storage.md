excerpt: >
  **Peer storage** is an optional service where a node accepts a small
  amount of frequently-updated encrypted data from its peers (especially
  channel counterparties).  It provides the latest version of that data
  back to the peer upon request, such as connection reestablishment.  The
  data can be a backup of the peer's latest channel state, allowing them
  to resume using a channel even if they lost their local state.
