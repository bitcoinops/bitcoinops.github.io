## Required.  Use Markdown formatting.  Only one paragraph.  No links allowed.
## Should be less than 500 characters
excerpt: >
  **Rendez-vous routing**, **hidden destinations**, and **blinded paths** are
  names for techniques that allow an LN node to send a payment to an
  unannounced node without learning where that node is in the
  network topology or what channels it shares with other nodes.
