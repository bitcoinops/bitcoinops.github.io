extended_summary: |
  In the context of Bitcoin, sidechains use a mechanism where bitcoins
  are deposited into a contract on the Bitcoin block chain and an equal
  number of bitcoins are created on the sidechain for spending.  Users
  on the sidechain can then send sidechain bitcoins to a special
  contract that destroys them and releases a corresponding amount of the
  bitcoins previously deposited to the contract on the Bitcoin block
  chain.

  **Federated sidechains** have depositors send their mainnet bitcoins
  to a multisig contract controlled by a federation of signatories who
  also control the production of blocks on the sidechain.

  **Drivechains** are a type of proposed decentralized sidechain where
  depositors send their mainnet bitcoins into a contract controlled by
  anonymous Bitcoin miners who also control the production of blocks on
  the sidechain.

## Optional.  Produces a Markdown link with either "[title][]" or
## "[title](link)"
