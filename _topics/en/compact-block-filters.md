excerpt: >
  **Compact block filters** are a condensed representation of the
  contents of a block that allow wallets to determine whether the block
  contains any transactions involving the user's keys.

extended_summary: |
  A full node uses [BIP158][] to create a Golomb-Rice Coded Set (GCS) of the
  data from each block in the block chain. The GCSs (called filters) are then
  distributed to wallets (such as via the P2P protocol as described in
  [BIP157][]), allowing them to search for any matches to their scripts.  If a
  match is found, the wallet can then download the corresponding block to access
  any relevant transactions.

    The GCS mechanism guarantees that a wallet following the protocol will find
    any transactions matching its scripts, but it may also find some
    false-positive matches for which it will need to download and scan
    the block despite the block not containing any transactions relevant
    to the wallet.

    The BIP157/158 protocol is sometimes incorrectly called "Neutrino" after the
    wallet library developed to use the protocol.  It's one of several
    methods that lightweight clients can use to acquire data about their
    wallet transactions.  Compared to [BIP37][] bloom filters, it offers
    more privacy against spy nodes and less risk of attack against
    honest nodes.  Compared to address-indexed servers (such as
    Electrum-style servers), it also provides more privacy and requires
    less server storage and CPU.  However, the BIP157/158 does consume
    significantly more bandwidth in the normal case than either of those
    other protocols.
