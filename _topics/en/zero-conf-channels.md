excerpt: >
  **Zero-conf channels**, also called turbo channels, are new
  single-funded channels where the funder gives some or all of their
  initial funds to the acceptor. Those funds are not secure until the
  channel open transaction receives a sufficient number of
  confirmations, so thereâ€™s no risk to the acceptor spending some of
  those funds back through the funder using the standard LN protocol.
---
For example, Alice has several BTC in an account at Bob's custodial
exchange.  Alice asks Bob to open a new channel paying her 1.0 BTC.
Because Bob trusts himself not to double-spend the channel he just
opened, he can allow Alice to send 0.1 BTC through his node to
third-party Carol even before the channel open transaction has received
a single confirmation.

Zero-conf channels were in use via various ad hoc mechanisms prior to a
standardized mechanisim for them being added to the LN protocol in 2022.
