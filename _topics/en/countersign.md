excerpt: >
  **Countersign** is the idea for a protocol that will allow a client and
  server who have each other's public keys to negotiate authentication
  without either participant revealing any identifying information to third parties.

## Optional.  Use Markdown formatting.  Multiple paragraphs.  Links allowed.
extended_summary: |
  This would make it easier to securely set up whitelisted nodes across
  the Internet for miners or exchanges, or to allow lightweight wallets
  to ensure they connect to trusted nodes.  By enabling authentication
  without revealing identity to third parties, nodes on anonymity
  networks (such as Tor) or nodes that simply changed IP addresses
  couldn't have their network identity tracked.

  The protocol should be compatible with the [version 2 P2P transport
  protocol][topic v2 p2p transport].

## Optional.  Produces a Markdown link with either "[title][]" or
## "[title](link)"
