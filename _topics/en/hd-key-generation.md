excerpt: >
  **HD key generation** as specified in **BIP32** allows securely
  creating an unlimited number of keypairs from a seed as small as 128
  bits.  A wallet may also create extended pubkeys (xpubs) that allow
  external software to create new pubkeys for the wallet without
  learning the corresponding private keys.
