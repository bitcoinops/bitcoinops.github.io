  **The BIP70 payment protocol** is an interactive protocol for
  sending payment requests and receiving payments.

  The protocol involves several steps:

  - Customer clicks a [BIP21][] `bitcoin:` URI extended with an
    additional `r` parameter (described in [BIP72][]).  The URI handler
    opens the user's wallet in response

  - The wallet contacts the merchant's server and asks for a payment request
    signed by the merchant's SSL certificate.  Upon receipt and
    validation of the signed payment request, the payment details are
    automatically filled out on the wallet's *Send Transaction* screen.
    Optionally, the user is notified that they're paying the owner of
    the domain corresponding to signing certificate (e.g.
    "example.com")

  - The customer reviews the payment details and clicks the *Send
    Transaction* button.  The transaction is generated and broadcast to
    the Bitcoin network.  A copy of the transaction is sent to the
    merchant, who then replies with an acknowledgment that the payment
    was received (optionally rebroadcasting the transaction from their
    own nodes)

  The protocol had several advantages over plain BIP21 URIs:

    - The merchant could request payment to any script---not just one
      of the popular address types---making the proposal forward
      compatible with new address formats

    - The customer's wallet automatically sent their own script to be
      used in case a refund needed to be issued

    - Payment requests had an expiration date after which point the quoted price
      would no longer apply

    - It gave the spending transaction directly to the merchant,
      allowing them to broadcast it.  This could allow a user to pay
      using Bluetooth or NFC even if they didn't currently have
      a connection to the Internet

  Its main disadvantage was that it required that spenders support the SSL
  certificate system, which includes many algorithms not otherwise used
  in Bitcoin and a complex Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system.  In
  practice, this meant software needed to include a library such as
  OpenSSL as a dependency.  Bugs in that library could then be used to
  exploit Bitcoin programs, such as the OpenSSL [heartbleed][]
  vulnerability that potentially allowed attackers to [access private
  keys][core heartbleed] from Bitcoin Core in 2014.

  Ultimately, BIP70 never saw widespread adoption and almost all
  merchants and wallets that did once support it have either ended
  support or plan to end their support in the future.

    ## they probably shouldn't be linked as primary documentation
