excerpt: >
  **Dandelion** is a privacy-enhancement proposal to allow transactions
  to first propagate serially from one node to one other node before
  being broadcast from one node to all of its peers.

## Optional.  Use Markdown formatting.  Multiple paragraphs.  Links allowed.
extended_summary: |
  This propagation behavior would help hide which node originated the
  transaction, especially if some of the nodes involved in the initial
  serial relay ("stem phase") encrypted their Bitcoin protocol traffic
  using either Tor or something like [v2 P2P transport][topic v2 p2p
  transport].

## Optional.  Produces a Markdown link with either "[title][]" or
## "[title](link)"
