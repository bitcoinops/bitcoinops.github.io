extended_summary: |
  The [BIP322][] *generic signed message format* allows a wallet to sign
  a text string in almost the same way the wallet would produce a
  signature for a Bitcoin transaction.  This means a signed message can
  be produced for any script or address that a wallet would be able to
  spend.  Additionally, two or more wallets can cooperate to create a
  BIP322 signed message for multisig scripts.

  When signing for legacy P2PKH addresses, BIP322 instead uses the
  traditional `signmessage` format that was first implemented in an
  early version of the Bitcoin software, making the proposal backwards
  compatible with existing software that verifies signed messages for
  P2PKH addresses.

## Optional.  Produces a Markdown link with either "[title][]" or
## "[title](link)"
