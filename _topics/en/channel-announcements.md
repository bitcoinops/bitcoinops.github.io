excerpt: >
  **Channel announcements** are advertisements that a channel is
  available to forward payments.  The advertisements are relayed through
  the LN gossip network.
---
Version 1 announcements require the nodes that want to advertise a
channel prove that they control a UTXO for
a P2WSH output for a 2-of-2 multisig script.  Proposed upgrades to the
announcements may allow UTXOs for other scripts to be used, making it
possible to advertise channels that use [P2TR][topic taproot],
[MuSig2][topic musig], and other technologies.  Other improvements have
been discussed that may break the link between UTXOs and specific
channels.
