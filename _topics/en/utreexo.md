excerpt: >
  **Utreexo** is a proposed alternative to the UTXO set for allowing
  full nodes to obtain and verify information about the UTXOs being
  spent in a transaction.

## Optional.  Use Markdown formatting.  Multiple paragraphs.  Links allowed.
extended_summary: |
  A merkle tree updated after every block accumulates references to
  every unspent transaction output, allowing nodes to skip storing the
  outputs themselves.  New transactions can be distributed with the
  UTXOs they spend and a merkle branch proving they're part of the
  utreexo merkle tree.  Overall, this can decrease the amount of storage
  full nodes need to a minimal amount at the cost of modest increases in
  bandwidth.  Utreexo would not change Bitcoin's security model.

## Optional.  Produces a Markdown link with either "[title][]" or
## "[title](link)"
