On May 14th, 2019, Bitcoin Optech hosted an Executive Briefing session at the
Chaincode Labs office in New York.  The seminars were targeted at executives and
founders of Bitcoin companies, and covered what we think are the most important
technical topics that executives needed to be aware of in 2019:

- [__A Return to Fees__](#a-return-to-fees) - why fees spike in Bitcoin, why
  high fees may return, and how businesses can thrive in a high-fee
  environment.
- [__Operating on Lightning__](#operating-on-lightning) - mainnet Lightning
  Network capacity has exploded in the last 12 months. A survey of how
  Lightning is being used now and discussion of opportunities for Bitcoin
  businesses adopting Lightning.
- [__The Next Softfork__](#the-next-softfork) - features of upcoming Bitcoin
  softfork proposals: Schnorr signatures, Taproot and SIGHASH_NOINPUT. What
  those changes could mean for businesses.

## A Return to Fees

The first presentation was given by Bitcoin Optech contributor Mike
Schmidt, and focused on transaction fees and ways to mitigate costs
and user confusion.
