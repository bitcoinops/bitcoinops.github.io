This week's newsletter links to a draft BIP for the proposed `OP_VAULT`
opcode, summarizes a discussion about allowing LN nodes to set a
quality-of-service flag on their channels, relays a request for feedback
on LN neighbor-node evaluation criteria, and describes a draft BIP for a
seed backup and recovery scheme that can be reliably performed without
electronics.  Also included are our regular sections with summaries of
popular questions and answers from the Bitcoin StackExchange,
announcements of new releases and release candidates, and descriptions
of notable changes to popular Bitcoin infrastructure software.

## News

- **Draft BIP for OP_VAULT:** James O'Beirne [posted][obeirne op_vault] to the
  Bitcoin-Dev mailing list a link to a [draft BIP][bip op_vault] for the
  `OP_VAULT` opcode he previously proposed (see [Newsletter
  #234][news234 vault]).  He also announced that he'll be attempting to
  get the code merged into Bitcoin Inquisition, a project for testing
  major proposed changes to Bitcoin's consensus and network protocol
  rules.

- **LN quality of service flag:** Joost Jager [posted][jager qos] to the
  Lightning-Dev mailing list a proposal to allow nodes to signal that a
  channel is "highly available", indicating that its operator believes
  it'll be able to forward payments without failure.  If it does fail to
  forward a payment, the spender may choose not to use that node for
  future payments for a very long time---a much longer duration than the
  spender may use for nodes that did not advertise high availability.
  Spenders maximizing payment speed (rather than low fees) would
  preferentially choose payment paths consisting of self-identified
  highly available nodes.

    Christian Decker [replied][decker qos] with an excellent summary of
    problems in reputation systems, including cases of self-proclaimed
    reputation.  One of his concerns was that typical spenders won't
    send anywhere near enough payments to frequently encounter the same
    nodes in a large network of payment channels.  If repeat business is
    rare anyway, then the threat of temporarily not providing repeat
    business may not be effective.

    Antoine Riard [reminded][riard boomerang] participants about an
    alternative approach to speeding up payments---overpayment with
    recovery.  Previously described as boomerang payments (see
    [Newsletter #86][news86 boomerang]) and refundable overpayments (see
    [Newsletter #192][news192 pp]), a spender would take their
    payment amount plus some extra money, split it into several
    [parts][topic multipath payments], and send the parts by a variety
    of routes.  When a sufficient number of parts has arrived to pay the
    invoice, the receiver claims just those parts and rejects any
    additional parts (with additional funds) that arrive later.  This
    requires spenders wanting fast payments to have some additional funds
    in their channel but it works even if some of the paths selected by the
    spender fail.  This reduces the need for spenders to be able to
    easily find highly available channels.  The challenge of this
    approach is building a mechanism that prevents receivers from
    keeping any overpayment that arrives.

- **Feedback requested on LN good neighbor scoring:** Carla Kirk-Cohen
  and Clara Shikhelman [posted][ckc-cs reputation] to the Lightning-Dev
  mailing list to request feedback on the recommend parameters for how a
  node should judge whether its channel counterparties are a good source of
  forwarded payments.  They suggest several criteria to judge by and
  recommended default parameters for each criterion, but are seeking
  feedback about the choices made.

    If a node determines that one of its peers is a good neighbor and
    that neighbor tags a forwarded payment as being endorsed by it, the
    node can give that payment access to more of its resources than it
    gives unqualified payments.  The node may also endorse the payment when
    forwarding it to the next channel.  As described in a prior paper
    co-authored by Shikhelman (see
    [Newsletter #226][news226 jam]), this is part of a proposal to
    mitigate [channel jamming attacks][topic channel jamming attacks].

- **Proposed BIP for Codex32 seed encoding scheme:** Russell O'Connor
  and Andrew Poelstra (using anagrams of their names) [proposed][op codex32] a BIP for
  a new scheme backing up and restoring [BIP32][] seeds.  Similar to
  [SLIP39][], it optionally allows creating several shares using
  [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme][] (SSSS), requiring that a configurable
  number of the shares to be used together to recover the seed.  An
  attacker who obtains less than the threshold number of shares will
  learn nothing about the seed.  Unlike BIP39, Electrum, Aezeed, and
  SLIP39 recovery codes that use a wordlist, Codex32 instead uses the
  same alphabet as [bech32][topic bech32] addresses.  An example share
  from the draft BIP:

    ```text
    ms12namea320zyxwvutsrqpnmlkjhgfedcaxrpp870hkkqrm
    ```

    The main advantage of Codex32 over all existing schemes is that all
    operations can be performed using just pen, paper, instructions, and
    paper cutouts.  That includes generating an encoded seed (dice can
    be used here), protecting the seed with a checksum, generating
    checksummed shares, verifying checksums, and recovering the seed.
    We found the idea of being able to manually verify checksums on
    backups of seeds or shares to be an especially powerful concept.
    The only current method users have to verify an individual seed
    backup is to enter it into a trusted computing device and see if it
    derives the expected public keys---but determining whether a device
    should be trusted is often not a trivial procedure.  Worse, in order
    to verify the integrity of existing SSSS shares (e.g. in SLIP39),
    the user must bring together each share they want to verify with enough
    other shares to reach the threshold and then enter them into a trusted
    computing device.  That means verifying share integrity negates a
    large benefit of having shares in the first place---the ability to
    keep information safe and secure by distributing it across multiple
    places or people.  With Codex32, users can verify the integrity of
    each share individually on a regular basis using just paper, pen,
    some printed materials, and a few minutes of time.

    Discussion on the mailing list mainly focused on the differences
    between Codex32 and SLIP39, which has been used in production for a
    couple of years now.  We recommend anyone interested in Codex32
    investigate its [website][codex32 website] or watch a
    [video][codex32 video] by one of its authors.  With the draft BIP,
    the authors hope to see wallets begin to add support for using
    Codex32-encoded seeds.

## Releases and release candidates

*New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure
projects.  Please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test
release candidates.*

- [BDK 0.27.1][] is a security update to fix a vulnerability that
  "sometimes [...] allows an array-bounds overflow when large string
  were input into SQLite's printf function".  Only software using BDK's
  optional SQLite's database feature needs to be updated.  See the
  [vulnerability report][RUSTSEC-2022-0090] for additional details.

- [Core Lightning 23.02rc3][] is a release candidate for a new
  maintenance version of this popular LN implementation.

Proposals (BIPs)][bips repo], and [Lightning BOLTs][bolts repo].*

- [Bitcoin Core #24149][] Signing support for Miniscript Descriptors FIXME:Xekyo

- [Bitcoin Core #25344][] updates the `bumpfee` and `psbtbumpfee` RPCs
  for creating [Replace By Fee][topic rbf] (RBF) fee bumps.  The update
  allows specifying outputs for the replacement tranaction.  The
  replacement may contain a
  different set of outputs than the transaction being replaced.  This
  can be used to add new outputs (e.g. for iterative [payment
  batching][topic payment batching]) or to remove outputs (e.g. for
  attempting to cancel an unconfirmed payment).

- [Eclair #2596][] limits the number of times a peer attempting to open
  a [dual funded][topic dual funding] channel can [RBF][topic rbf] fee
  bump the channel open transaction before the node won't accept any
  further attempted updates.  This is motivated by the node needing to
  store data about all possible versions of the channel open
  transaction, so allowing unlimited fee bumps could be a problem.
  Normally, the number of fee bumps that can be created is bounded in
  practice by the need for each replacement to pay additional transaction
  fees.  However, the dual funding protocol expects a node to store
  even those fee bumps it can't fully validate, meaning an attacker
  could create an unlimited number of invalid fee bump transactions that
  will never confirm and never cost it any transaction fees.

- [Eclair #2595][] continues the project's work on adding support for
  [splicing][topic splicing], in this case with updates to the functions
  used for constructing transactions.

- [Eclair #2479][] adds support for paying [offers][topic offers] in the following flow: a
  user receives an offer, tells Eclair to pay it, Eclair uses the offer
  to fetch an invoice from the receiver, verifies the invoice contains
  the expected parameters, and pays the invoice.

- [LND #5988][] adds a new optional probability estimator for finding
  payment paths.  It is partly based on previous pathfinding research
  (see [Newsletter #192][news192 pp]) with additional input from other
  approaches.

- [Rust Bitcoin #1636][] adds a `predict_weight()` function.  Input to
  the function is a template for the transaction to construct; output is the expected
  weight of the transaction.  This is especially useful for fee
  management: to determine which inputs need to be added to a
  transaction, the fee amount needs to be known, but to determine
  the fee amount, the size of the transaction needs to be known.
  The function can provide a reasonable size estimate without actually
  having to construct a candidate transaction.
