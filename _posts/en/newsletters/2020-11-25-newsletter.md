This week's newsletter links to a website that tracks miner support for
taproot activation, announces a new organization funding Bitcoin
research and development, and includes our regular sections with popular
questions and answers from the Bitcoin StackExchange, announcements of
releases and release candidates, and notable changes to popular Bitcoin
infrastructure software.

## Action items

*None this week.*

## News

- **Website listing miner support for taproot activation:** Bitcoin
  mining pool [Poolin][] has created [a website][taprootactivation.com]
  to help track miner support for activating
  [taproot][topic taproot] (including [schnorr signatures][topic schnorr
  signatures] and [tapscript][topic tapscript]).  As of this writing,
  all pools listed on the site---who represent more than half of the
  current network hash rate---have indicated that they will support
  activation.  If this is reflective of the opinions of the remaining
  pools, then it should be easy to accomplish the activation of taproot
  after its implementation has been released and adopted by a moderate
  number of users.  For additional information about the creation of the
  website, see Bitcoin Magazine's [article][btcmag ta.com].

## Selected Q&A from Bitcoin StackExchange

*[Bitcoin StackExchange][bitcoin.se] is one of the first places Optech
contributors look for answers to their questions---or when we have a
few spare moments to help curious or confused users.  In
this monthly feature, we highlight some of the top-voted questions and
answers posted since our last update.*

## Releases and release candidates

*New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure
projects.  Please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test
release candidates.*

- [C-Lightning 0.9.2][C-Lightning 0.9.2] is the release for
  the next maintenance version of C-Lightning.  It contains "new CLI-level
  notifications, better channel state reporting, and stable plugin-hook
  call ordering" in addition to other new features and bug fixes.  The
  release notes do warn that [PSBTs][topic psbt] generated by this
  version of C-Lightning will be rejected by some older versions of
  Bitcoin Core (versions 0.20.0 and earlier); this is a consequence of a
  change made to the [PSBT specification][news109 bips948] and [Bitcoin
  Core][news105 core19215] to defend against a possible [fee overpayment
  attack][].

## Notable code and documentation changes

*Notable changes this week in [Bitcoin Core][bitcoin core repo],
[C-Lightning][c-lightning repo], [Eclair][eclair repo], [LND][lnd repo],
[Rust-Lightning][rust-lightning repo], [libsecp256k1][libsecp256k1 repo],
[Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI)][hwi repo], [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals
(BIPs)][bips repo], and [Lightning BOLTs][bolts repo].*

*Note: some commits to Bitcoin Core mentioned below apply to its
development branch and so those changes will likely not be released
until version 0.22, about six months after the release of the upcoming
version 0.21.*

- [Bitcoin Core #20305][] and [Bitcoin Core #20426][] wallet: introduce fee_rate sat/vB param/option FIXME:jonatack

- [Bitcoin Core #20145][] adds a `getcoins.py` script that can be used
  to request testing coins from a faucet for [signet][topic signet].

- [Bitcoin Core #20223][] removes the leading `0` from Bitcoin Core's
  version number for major releases after 0.21.0.  This means Bitcoin
  Core's next release will be 0.21.0; incremental releases during the
  subsequent months (perhaps including a [taproot][topic taproot]
  release) will be 0.21.1 to 0.21.x; and the following major release
  will be 22.0 (expected mid-2021).
