## News

- **Vulnerability allowing theft from LN channels with miner assistance:**
  David Harding [announced][harding irrev] to Delving Bitcoin a
  vulnerability he had [responsibly disclosed][topic responsible
  disclosures] earlier in the year.  Old versions of Eclair, LDK, and
  LND with default settings allowed the party who opened a channel to
  steal up to 98% of channel value.  Core Lightning remains affected if
  the non-default `--ignore-fee-limits` configuration option is used;
  this option's documentation already indicates it is dangerous.

  The announcement also described two less severe variants of the vulnerability.
  All LN implementations listed above attempt to mitigate those
  additional risks, but a complete solution awaits additional work on
  [package relay][topic package relay], [channel upgrades][topic channel
  commitment upgrades], and related projects.

  The vulnerability takes advantage of the LN protocol allowing an old
  channel state to commit to more onchain fees than the
  fee-paying party controls in the latest state.  For example, in a
  state where Mallory controls 99% of the channel balance, she dedicates 98%
  of the overall balance to [endogenous][topic fee sourcing] fees.  She then
  creates a new state that pays only minimal fees and forwards 99% of
  the channel balance to Bob's side.  By personally mining the old state
  that pays 98% to fees, she can capture those fees for
  herself---reducing the maximum value Bob can receive onchain from his
  expected 99% to an actual 2%.  Mallory can use this method to
  simultaneously steal from about 3,000 channels per block (with each
  channel potentially controlled by a different victim), allowing theft
  of about $3 million USD per block if the average channel value is
  about $1,000 USD.

  Users who became aware of the attack before losing their funds would
  not have been able to protect themselves by shutting down their LN
  nodes, as Mallory may have already created the necessary states.  Even
  if the victims attempted to force close their channels in their latest
  state (e.g., where Bob controls 99% of channel value), Mallory could
  cause them to lose 98% of channel value by sacrificing 1% of channel
  value herself.

  The worst-case vulnerability was fixed, and the less severe variants
  partly mitigated, by limiting the maximum amount of channel value that
  can be dedicated to fees.  As fees in an earlier state are still
  allowed to be higher than the amount the fee-paying party controls in
  a later state, some theft is still possible---but the amount is
  bounded.  A complete solution awaits improvements in fully
  [exogenous][topic fee sourcing] fee sourcing (such as all states paying
  the same commitment transaction fee), which depends on robust package
  relay for [CPFP][topic cpfp] fee bumping in the Bitcoin P2P protocol
  and channel commitment transaction upgrades for LN.

- **Deanonymization vulnerability affecting Wasabi and related software:**
  a developer of GingerWallet [disclosed][drkgry deanon] a method a
  [coinjoin][topic coinjoin] coordinator could use to prevent users from
  gaining any privacy during a coinjoin.  Bitcoin Magazine journalist
  Shinobi [reports][shinobi deanon] that the vulnerability was
  originally discovered in 2021 by Yuval Kogman and [reported][wasabi
  #5439] to the Wasabi development team along with several other
  problems.  Optech has been aware since mid-2022 that Kogman had
  serious outstanding concerns with deployed versions of Wasabi but we
  neglected to investigate further; we apologize to him and Wasabi
  users for our failure.

- **Insights into channel depletion:** RenÃ© Pickhardt [posted][pickhardt
  deplete] to Delving Bitcoin and [participated][dd deplete], along with
  Christian Decker, in an Optech Deep Dive about his research into the
  mathematical foundations of payment channel networks (namely LN).  A
  particular focus of his Delving Bitcoin post was a discovery that some
  channels in circular paths on the network will eventually become
  depleted if the path is used enough.  When a channel is effectively
  fully depleted, meaning it cannot forward additional payments in the
  depleted direction, the circular path (cycle) is broken.  As each
  cycle in the network graph is successively broken, the network
  converges on a residual graph that has no cycles (a spanning tree).
  This replicates a [prior result][guidi spanning] from researcher
  Gregorio Guidi, although Pickhardt arrived at it from a different
  approach, and also appears to be confirmed in unpublished research by
  Anastasios Sidiropoulos.

  ![Example of cycles, depletion, and residual spanning tree](/img/posts/2024-12-depletion.png)

  Perhaps the most notable insight provided by this result is that
  widespread channel depletion occurs even in a circular economy where
  there are no source nodes (i.e., net spenders) and sink nodes (i.e.,
  net receivers).  If LN was used for every
  payment---customer-to-business, business-to-business, and
  business-to-worker---it would still converge on a spanning tree.

  It's not clear whether nodes would want their channels to be part of
  the residual spanning tree or not.  On one hand, that tree represents
  the last part of the network that would still be capable of forwarding
  payments---it's equivalent to a hub-and-spoke topology---so it may be
  possible to charge high forwarding fees across the residual channels.
  On the other hand, the residual channels are what's left after all
  other channels have already collected fees to depletion.

  Although a channel with higher forwarding fees is less likely to
  become depleted (all other things being equal), the properties of
  other channels in the same cycles strongly influence the likelihood of
  depletion, making it challenging for a node operator to attempt to use
  control over their forwarding fees alone to prevent depletion.

  Higher capacity channels are also less likely to become depleted than
  lower capacity channels.  That seems obvious, but carefully
  considering the reason for it yields a surprising insight about k>2
  multiparty offchain protocols.  A higher capacity channel supports a
  greater number of wealth distributions between its participants, so
  payments through it remain feasible when equivalent payments through
  lower capacity channels would exhaust a party's balance.  For two
  participants, as in current-generation LN channels, each additional
  satoshi given to capacity will increase the range of the wealth
  distribution by one.  However, in [channel factories][topic channel
  factories] and other multiparty constructions that allow funds to move
  offchain between _k_ parties, each additional sat given to capacity
  increases the range of wealth distributions by one _for each of the
  k parties_---exponentially increasing the number of feasible payments and
  reducing the risk of depletion.

  Consider an example of the current LN where Alice has
  channels with Bob and Carol, who also have a channel with each
  other: {AB, AC, BC}.  Each channel has a capacity of 1 BTC.  In this
  configuration, the maximum value Alice can control (and thus send or
  receive) is 2 BTC.  The same limit applies to Bob and Carol.  These
  limits would also apply if the total of 3 BTC were used to recreate all
  three channels in a channel factory; however, if the factory
  remained operational, an offchain state update between all three
  parties could zero out the channel between Bob and Carol, allowing
  Alice to control up to the full 3 BTC (and thus she could send or
  receive up to 3 BTC).  A subsequent state update could do the same for
  Bob and Carol, also allowing them to send or receive up to 3 BTC.
  This use of multiparty offchain protocols allows the same amount of
  capital to give each participant access to higher-capacity channels
  that are less likely to become depleted.  Fewer depletions and an
  expanded range of feasible payments correspond to a greater maximum
  throughput of LN, as Pickhardt has written about before (see
  Newsletters [#309][news309 feasible] and [#325][news325 feasible]).

  In both his post and the Optech Deep Dive discussion, Pickhardt
  sought data (e.g., from large LSPs) that could be used to help
  validate the simulated results.

- **Poll of opinions about covenant proposals:** /dev/fd0 [posted][fd0
  poll] to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list a link to a [public poll][wiki
  poll] of developer opinions about selected [covenant][topic covenants] proposals.  Yuval
  Kogman [noted][kogman poll] that developers were asked to evaluate
  both the "technical merit of [each] proposal" and their "vibes-based
  opinion about [its] community support," but without developers being
  able to express all possible combinations of the two through the
  poll's limited options.  Jonas Nick [requested][nick poll] "separating
  technical evaluations from community support," and Anthony Towns
  [suggested][towns poll] simply asking developers whether they had any
  outstanding concerns about each proposal.  Nick and Towns separately
  recommended developers link to evidence and arguments supporting their
  opinions.

  Although the discussion highlighted faults in the poll, a showing of more
  support for some proposals over others may help covenant
  researchers converge on a short list of ideas for the broader
  community to review.

- **Incentive-based pseudo-covenants:** Jeremy Rubin [posted][rubin
  unfed] to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list a link to a [paper][rubin unfed
  paper] he authored about oracle-assisted [covenants][topic covenants].
  The model involves two oracles: a _covenant oracle_ and an _integrity
  oracle_.  The covenant oracle places funds in a fidelity bond and
  agrees to only sign transactions based on a program returning success.
  The integrity oracle can seize funds from a bond by using [accountable
  computing][topic acc] to prove a signature was created for a program
  that did not return success.  If fraud occurs, there is no guarantee
  that a user who lost money due to the covenant oracle's deceit will
  recover lost funds.

  Ethan Heilman independently [posted][heilman slash] to the Bitcoin-Dev
  mailing list a different construction that allows anyone to use a
  fraud proof to punish incorrect signing.  However, in this case, the
  funds are not seized but destroyed.  This ensures a fraudulent signer
  is punished but prevents victims from recovering their lost value.

- **Bitcoin Core developer meeting summaries:** many Bitcoin Core
  developers met in person in October, and several notes from the
  meeting have now been [published][coredev notes].  Discussions topics
  included [adding payjoin support][], creating [multiple binaries][]
  that communicate with each other, a [mining interface][] and [Stratum
  v2 support][], improved [benchmarking][] and [flamegraphs][], an [API
  for libbitcoinkernel][], preventing [block stalling][], improvements
  to [RPC code][] inspired by Core Lightning, resumed [development of
  erlay][], and [contemplating covenants][].

## Bitcoin Core PR Review Club

*In this monthly section, we summarize a recent [Bitcoin Core PR Review
Club][] meeting, highlighting some of the important questions and
answers.  Click on a question below to see a summary of the answer from
the meeting.*

[Track and use all potential peers for orphan resolution][review club 31397]
is a PR by [glozow][gh glozow] that improves the reliability of
orphan resolution by letting the node request missing ancestors from all
peers instead of just the one that announced the orphan. It does so by
introducing `m_orphan_resolution_tracker` which is responsible for
remembering which peers are candidates for orphan resolution and for
scheduling when to make orphan resolution requests. The approach is
designed to be bandwidth-efficient, to not be vulnerable to censorship,
and to load-balance between peers.

{% include functions/details-list.md
  q0="What is orphan resolution?"
  a0="A transaction is referred to as an orphan when the node doesn't
  have at least one of the transactions the orphan is spending from.
  Orphan resolution is the process of trying to find these missing
  transactions."
  a0link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/31397#l-23"

  q1="Prior to this PR, what are the steps for orphan resolution,
  starting from when we notice that the transaction has missing inputs?"
  a1="When a node receives an orphan transaction, it will request the
  parent transaction from the same peer that sent the orphan. Other
  peers aren't actively queried, but may still send us the parent, for
  example when they announce it via an INV message, or when they send
  another orphan with the same missing parent."
  a1link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/31397#l-29"

  q2="What are the ways we may fail to resolve an orphan with the peer
  we request its parents from? What are some reasons this may
  happen, honest or otherwise?"
  a2="An honest peer may simply have been disconnected, or it may have
  evicted the parent from its mempool. A malicious peer may just not
  respond to the request, or it may send a parent with malleated,
  invalid witness data which results in the parent having the expected
  txid while failing validation."
  a2link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/31397#l-49"

  q3="How could an attacker prevent a node from downloading a 1p1c
  package by exploiting todayâs orphan resolution behavior?"
  a3="An attacker can announce a malleated orphan unsolicited (see previous question).
  Once the malleated orphan transaction is accepted in the orphanage,
  the honest orphan transaction will no longer be accepted because it
  has the same txid. This prevents the package from being relayed.
  Alternatively, an attacker could flood a node with orphan
  transactions. Because the orphanage is limited in size, and
  transactions are evicted randomly, this will affect how well a node
  can download 1p1c packages."
  a3link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/31397#l-64"

  q4="What is the PRâs solution to the problem in the previous question?"
  a4="Instead of adding the orphan's missing parent to the
  transaction request tracker, the orphan transaction is added to the
  newly introduced `m_orphan_resolution_tracker`. This orphan resolution
  tracker schedules when the parent transaction should be requested from
  different peers, and then adds those requests to the regular
  transaction request tracker. Attendees suggested and discussed an
  alternative approach that doesn't require an additional
  `m_orphan_resolution_tracker`, and this approach will be investigated
  further by the author."
  a4link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/31397#l-81"

  q5="In this PR, which peers do we identify as potential candidates for
  orphan resolution, and why?"
  a5="All the peers who announced a transaction that turned out to be an
  orphan transaction are marked as potential candidates for orphan
  resolution."
  a5link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/31397#l-127"

  q6="What does the node do if a peer announces a transaction that is
  currently a to-be-resolved orphan?"
  a6="Instead of adding the transaction to m_txrequest tracker, the peer
  is added as an orphan resolution candidate. This helps with preventing
  attacks such as described in the previous question about 1p1c
  package censorship."
  a6link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/31397#l-148"

  q7="Why might we prefer to resolve orphans with outbound peers over
  inbound peers?"
  a7="Outbound peers are selected by the node and are therefore
  considered more trustworthy. While outbound peers may be malicious, at
  least they are much less likely to be specifically targeting your
  node."
  a7link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/31397#l-251"

## Notable code and documentation changes

_Notable recent changes in [Bitcoin Core][bitcoin core repo], [Core
Lightning][core lightning repo], [Eclair][eclair repo], [LDK][ldk repo],
[LND][lnd repo], [libsecp256k1][libsecp256k1 repo], [Hardware Wallet
Interface (HWI)][hwi repo], [Rust Bitcoin][rust bitcoin repo], [BTCPay
Server][btcpay server repo], [BDK][bdk repo], [Bitcoin Improvement
Proposals (BIPs)][bips repo], [Lightning BOLTs][bolts repo],
[Lightning BLIPs][blips repo], [Bitcoin Inquisition][bitcoin inquisition
repo], and [BINANAs][binana repo]._

- [Bitcoin Core #31096][] removes restrictions on the `submitpackage` RPC
  command (see [Newsletter #272][news272 submitpackage]) that disallowed
  packages containing only a single transaction by changing the logic of the
  `AcceptPackage` function and relaxing the checks on `submitpackage`. While a
  single transaction does not technically qualify as a package under the
  [package relay][topic package relay] specification, there is no reason to
  prevent users from submitting transactions that comply with network policies
  using this command.

- [Bitcoin Core #31175][] removes redundant pre-checks from the `submitblock`
  RPC command and `bitcoin-chainstate.cpp` that validate whether a block
  contains a coinbase transaction or is a duplicate, as these checks are already
  done in `ProcessNewBlock`. This change standardizes behavior across
  interfaces, such as the mining IPC (see [Newsletter #323][news323 ipc]) and
  `net_processing`, to prepare Bitcoin Core for the
  [libbitcoinkernel][libbitcoinkernel project] API project. In addition,
  duplicate blocks submitted with `submitblock` will now persist their data even
  if it was previously pruned and the data will eventually be pruned again when
  the block file is selected for pruning, to be consistent with the behavior of
  `getblockfrompeer`.

- [Bitcoin Core #31112][] extends the `CCheckQueue` functionality to improve
  script error logging during multi-threaded script validation conditions.
  Previously, detailed error reporting was only available when running with
  `par=1` (single-threaded script validation) due to limited information
  transfer between threads. In addition, the logging now includes details about
  which transaction input had the script error and which UTXO was spent.

- [LDK #3446][] adds support for including a [trampoline payment][topic
  trampoline payments] flag on [BOLT12][topic offers] invoices. This doesn't
  provide full support for using trampoline routing or providing a trampoline
  routing service, but serves to lay the groundwork for future functionality.
  Support for trampoline payments is a prerequisite for a type of [async payments][topic
  async payments] that LDK plans to deploy.

- [Rust Bitcoin #3682][] adds several tools to stabilize the public API
  interface for the `hashes`, `io`, `primitives` and `units` crates such as
  pre-generated API text files, a script that generates those text files using
  `cargo check-api`, a script that easily queries those API text files, and a CI
  job that compares API code and its corresponding text file to easily detect
  unintentional API changes. This PR also updates the documentation to outline
  the expectations for contributing developers: when they update an
  API endpoint of these crates, they must run the text file generation script.

- [BTCPay Server #5743][] introduces the concept of a "pending transaction" for
  multisig and watch-only wallets, which is a [PSBT][topic psbt] that does not
  require an immediate signature. The transaction collects signatures as signers
  come online and provide them, and when there are enough signatures, it is
  broadcasted. This PR also automatically marks transactions as complete when
  signed out-of-band, invalidates pending transactions when the associated UTXOs
  are spent elsewhere, and allows for optional expiry times to avoid outdated
  feerates. This system allows a payout processor to create pending transactions
  for payouts awaiting signatures and to cancel or replace pending transactions with
  updated versions if payouts change and signatures haven't been collected. The
  enabled functionality was deemed only possible with hot wallets. This system
  can be extended to send emails when a pending transaction is created to alert
  signers to come online.

- [BDK #1756][] adds an exception to `fetch_prev_txout` to prevent it from
  trying to query the prevouts (outputs from previous transactions) of coinbase
  transactions, since they have none. Previously, this behavior caused
  `bdk_electrum` to crash and the sync or full scan process to fail.

- [BIPs #1535][] merges [BIP348][] for the specification of the
  [OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK][topic op_checksigfromstack] opcode, which allows to
  check if a signature signs an arbitrary message. It puts a signature, a
  message, and a public key on the stack, and the signature must match both the
  public key and the message. This is one of the many [covenant][topic
  covenants] proposals.

- [BOLTs #1180][] updates [BOLT12][topic offers] to specify the optional
  inclusion of [BIP353][] human-readable Bitcoin payment instructions in
  the invoice request (see [Newsletter #290][news290 omdns]).   [BLIPs #48][]
  updates [BLIP32][] (see [Newsletter #306][news306 blip32]) to reference the
  update to [BOLT12][].
