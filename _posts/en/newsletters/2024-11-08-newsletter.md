This week's newsletter describes a vulnerability affecting old versions
of Bitcoin Core and includes our regular sections summarizing a Bitcoin
Core PR Review Club meeting, announcing new releases and release
candidates, and describing notable changes to popular Bitcoin
infrastructure software.

## News

- **Disclosure of a vulnerability affecting Bitcoin Core versions before 25.1:**
  Antoine Poinsot [announced][poinsot stall] to the Bitcoin-Dev
  mailing list the final vulnerability disclosure predating Bitcoin
  Core's new disclosure policy (see [Newsletter #306][news306
  disclosure]).  The [detailed vulnerability report][stall vuln] notes
  that Bitcoin Core versions 25.0 and earlier were susceptible to an
  inappropriate P2P protocol response that would delay a node from
  re-requesting a block for up to 10 minutes.  The solution was to allow
  blocks to "be requested concurrently from up to 3 high-bandwidth
  compact block peers, one of which is required to be an outbound
  connection." Versions 25.1 and later include the fix.

## Bitcoin Core PR Review Club

*In this monthly section, we summarize a recent [Bitcoin Core PR Review
Club][] meeting, highlighting some of the important questions and
answers.  Click on a question below to see a summary of the answer from
the meeting.*

[Ephemeral Dust][review club 30239] is a PR by [instagibbs][gh
instagibbs] that makes transactions with ephemeral dust standard,
improving the usability of both keyed as well as unkeyed ([P2A][topic
ephemeral anchors]) anchors. This is relevant for several off-chain
contracting schemes including those used by Lightning Network, [Ark][topic ark],
Timeout Trees, and other constructs with large pre-signed trees or other
large-N party smart contracts.

With the ephemeral dust policy changes, zero-fee transactions with a
[dust][topic uneconomical outputs] output are allowed in the mempool if
a valid [fee-paying child][topic cpfp] transaction that immediately spends the dust
output is known to the node.

{% include functions/details-list.md
  q0="Is dust restricted by consensus? Policy? Both?"
  a0="Dust outputs are only restricted by policy rules, they are not
  affected by consensus."
  a0link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/30239#l-27"

  q1="How can dust be problematic?"
  a1="Dust (or uneconomical) outputs are worth less than the fees
  required to spend them. Since they can be spent, they cannot be pruned
  from the UTXO set. Because spending them is uneconomical, they often
  remain unspent, increasing the UTXO set size. A larger UTXO set raises
  the resource requirements for nodes. However, UTXOs may still be spent
  due to external incentives beyond their satoshi value, such as in the
  case of [anchor outputs][topic anchor outputs]."
  a1link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/30239#l-40"

  q2="Why is the term ephemeral significant? What are the proposed rules
  specific to ephemeral dust?"
  a2="The term 'ephemeral' indicates that the dust output is intended to
  be spent quickly. Ephemeral dust rules require the parent transaction
  to be 0-fee and to have exactly one child transaction that spends the
  dust output."
  a2link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/30239#l-50"

  q3="Why is it important to impose a fee restriction?"
  a3="A key goal is to prevent dust outputs from remaining unspent when
  confirmed. By requiring the parent transaction to be 0-fee, miners
  lack the incentive to mine the parent without the child. Since
  ephemeral dust is a policy rule, not a consensus rule, economic
  incentives play a crucial role."
  a3link="https://bitcoincore.reviews/30239#l-56"

  q4="How are 1P1C relay and TRUC transactions relevant to ephemeral dust?"
  a4="As an ephemeral dust transaction must be 0-fee, it cannot be
  relayed alone, making mechanisms like [1-parent-1-child (1P1C)][28.0 integration guide]
  essential. TRUC (v3) transactions are limited to a single unconfirmed
  parent, aligning with the ephemeral dust requirement. TRUC is
  currently the only way to allow transactions with a feerate below the
  [`minrelaytxfee`][topic default minimum transaction relay feerates]."

## Releases and release candidates

_New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure
projects.  Please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test
release candidates._

- [Bitcoin Core 27.2][] is a maintenance update for the previous release
  series containing bug fixes.  Any users who will not soon upgrade to
  the latest version, [28.0][], should consider updating at least to
  this new maintenance release.

- [Libsecp256k1 0.6.0][] is a release of this library of Bitcoin-related
  cryptographic operations.  "This release adds a [MuSig2][topic musig]
  module, adds a significantly more robust method to clear secrets from
  the stack, and removes the unused `secp256k1_scratch_space` functions."

## Notable code and documentation changes

_Notable recent changes in [Bitcoin Core][bitcoin core repo], [Core
Lightning][core lightning repo], [Eclair][eclair repo], [LDK][ldk repo],
[LND][lnd repo], [libsecp256k1][libsecp256k1 repo], [Hardware Wallet
Interface (HWI)][hwi repo], [Rust Bitcoin][rust bitcoin repo], [BTCPay
Server][btcpay server repo], [BDK][bdk repo], [Bitcoin Improvement
Proposals (BIPs)][bips repo], [Lightning BOLTs][bolts repo],
[Lightning BLIPs][blips repo], [Bitcoin Inquisition][bitcoin inquisition
repo], and [BINANAs][binana repo]._

- [LDK #3360][] adds rebroadcasting of `channel_announcement` messages every six
  blocks for one week after the public channel is confirmed. This removes the
  dependency on peers for rebroadcast and ensures that channels are always
  visible to the network.

- [LDK #3207][] introduces support for including invoice requests in the [async
  paymentsâ€™][topic async payments] [onion message][topic onion messages] when
  paying static [BOLT12][topic offers] invoices as an always online sender. This
  was previously missing from the PR covered in Newsletter [#321][news321
  invreq]. The inclusion of invoice requests in payment onions also extends to
  retries, see Newsletter [#321][news321 retry].
