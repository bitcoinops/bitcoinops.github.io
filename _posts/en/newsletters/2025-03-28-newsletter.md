This week's newsletter describes a proposal to allow LN to support
upfront and hold fees based on burnable outputs, summarizes discussion
about testnets 3 and 4 (including a hard fork proposal), and announces a
plan to begin relaying certain transactions containing taproot annexes.
Also included are our regular sections summarizing selected questions
and answers from the Bitcoin Stack Exchange, announcing new releases and
release candidates, and describing notable changes to popular Bitcoin
infrastructure projects.

## News

- **LN upfront and hold fees using burnable outputs:** John Law
  [posted][law fees] to Delving Bitcoin the summary of a [paper][law fee
  paper] he's written about a protocol nodes can use to charge two
  additional types of fees for forwarding payments.  An _upfront fee_
  would be paid by the ultimate spender to compensate forwarding nodes
  for temporarily using an _HTLC slot_ (one of the limited number of
  concurrent allocations available in a channel for enforcing
  [HTLCs][topic htlc]).  A _hold fee_ would be paid by any node that
  delays the settlement of an HTLC; the amount of this fee would scale with
  the length of the delay up until the maximum amount was reached at the
  time the HTLC expired.  His post and paper cite several prior
  discussions about upfront and hold fees, such as those summarized in
  Newsletters [#86][news86 reverse upfront], [#119][news119 trusted
  upfront], [#120][news120 upfront], [#122][news122 bi-directional],
  [#136][news136 more fee], and [#263][news263 dos philosophy].

  The proposed protocol builds on the ideas of Law's _offchain payment
  resolution_ (OPR) protocol (see [Newsletter #329][news329 opr]), which
  has channel co-owners each allocate 100% of the amount of funds at stake
  (so 200% total) to a _burnable output_ that either of them can
  unilaterally destroy.  The funds at stake in this case are the upfront
  fee plus the maximum hold fees.  If both parties are later satisfied
  that the protocol has been followed correctly, e.g. that all fees were
  paid correctly, they remove the burnable output from future versions
  of their offchain transactions.  If either party is unsatisfied, they
  close the channel and destroy the burnable funds.  Although the
  unsatisfied party loses funds in this case, so does the other party,
  preventing either party from benefiting from violating the protocol.

  Law describes the protocol as a solution for [channel jamming
  attacks][topic channel jamming attacks], a weakness in LN first
  described [almost a decade ago][russell loop] that allows an attacker
  to almost costlessly prevent other nodes from using some or all of
  their funds.  In a [reply][harding fee], it was noted that the
  addition of hold fees might make [hold invoices][topic hold invoices]
  more sustainable for the network. {% assign timestamp="0:54" %}

- **Discussion of testnets 3 and 4:** Sjors Provoost [posted][provoost
  testnet3] to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list to ask whether anyone was
  still using testnet3 now that testnet4 has been available for about
  six months (see [Newsletter #315][news315 testnet4]).  Andres
  Schildbach [replied][schildbach testnet3] with an intention to
  continue using testnet3 in the testnet version of his popular wallet
  for at least a year.  Olaoluwa Osuntokun [noted][osuntokun testnet3]
  that testnet3 has recently been much more stable than testnet4.  He
  illustrated his point by including screenshots of the
  block trees for both testnets taken from the [Fork.Observer][]
  website.  Below find our own screenshot showing the state of testnet4
  at the time of writing:

  ![Fork Monitor showing the tree of blocks on testnet4 on 2025-03-25](/img/posts/2025-03-fork-monitor-testnet3.png)

  After Osuntokun's post, Antoine Poinsot started a [separate
  thread][poinsot testnet4] to focus on the testnet4 issues.  He argues
  that the testnet4 problems are a consequence of the difficulty reset
  rule.  This rule, which only applies to testnet, allows a block to be
  valid with minimum difficulty if its header time is 20 minutes later
  than its parent block.  Provoost goes into more [detail][provoost
  testnet4] about the problem.  Poinsot proposes a testnet4 hard fork
  to remove the rule.  Mark Erhardt [suggests][erhardt testnet4] a date
  for the fork: 2026-01-08. {% assign timestamp="5:11" %}

- **Plan to relay certain taproot annexes:** Peter Todd [announced][todd
  annex] to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list his plan to update his Bitcoin
  Core-based node, Libre Relay, to begin relaying transactions
  containing taproot [annexes][topic annex] if they follow particular
  rules:

  - _0x00 prefix:_ "all non-empty annexes start with the byte 0x00, to
    distinguish them from [future] consensus-relevant annexes."

  - _All-or-nothing:_ "All inputs have an annex. This ensures that use
    of the annex is opt-in, preventing [transaction pinning][topic
    transaction pinning] attacks in multi-party protocols."

  The plan is based on a 2023 [pull request][bitcoin core #27926] by
  Joost Jager, which was itself based on a prior discussion started by
  Jager (see [Newsletter #255][news255 annex]).  In Jager's words, the
  previous pull request also "limit[ed] the maximum size of unstructured
  annex data to 256 bytes [...] somewhat protect[ing] participants in a
  multi-party transaction that uses the annex against annex inflation."
  Todd's version does not include this rule; he believes "the
  requirement to opt-in to annex usage should be sufficient".  If it's
  not, he describes an additional relay change that could prevent
  counterparty pinning.

  As of this writing, nobody in the current mailing list thread has
  described how they expect the annex to be used. {% assign timestamp="19:01" %}

## Selected Q&A from Bitcoin Stack Exchange

*[Bitcoin Stack Exchange][bitcoin.se] is one of the first places Optech
contributors look for answers to their questions---or when we have a
few spare moments to help curious or confused users.  In
this monthly feature, we highlight some of the top-voted questions and
answers posted since our last update.*

{% comment %}<!-- https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&q=created%3a1m..%20is%3aanswer -->{% endcomment %}
{% assign bse = "https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/" %}

- [Why is the witness commitment optional?]({{bse}}125948)
  Pieter Wuille and Antoine Poinsot explain [BIP30][] "Duplicate transactions",
  [BIP34][] "Block v2, Height in Coinbase", and [consensus cleanup][topic
  consensus cleanup] considerations around the [block 1,983,702 problem][topic
  duplicate transactions] and how making the witness commitment mandatory would
  resolve the problem. {% assign timestamp="24:58" %}

- [Can all consensus valid 64 byte transactions be (third party) malleated to change their size?]({{bse}}125971)
  Sjors Provoost explores ideas for malleating any [64-byte transactions][news27
  64tx] that would be consensus invalid if the [consensus cleanup][topic
  consensus cleanup] soft fork were activated.  VojtÄ›ch Strnad argues
  that not every 64-byte transaction can be mutated by a third party,
  but it would still be the case that the output of a 64-byte
  would either be insecure (spendable by anyone) or provably
  unspendable (e.g., an `OP_RETURN`). {% assign timestamp="36:39" %}

- [How long does it take for a transaction to propagate through the network?]({{bse}}125776)
  Sr_gi points out that a single node cannot measure network-wide transaction
  propagation times and that multiple nodes throughout the Bitcoin network would
  be required to measure and estimate propagation times. He points to a
  [website][dsn kit] run by the Decentralized Systems and Network Services
  Research Group at KIT that measures, among other things, transaction
  propagation times that shows "a transaction takes about ~7 seconds to reach
  50% of the network, and about ~17 seconds to reach 90%". {% assign timestamp="47:37" %}

- [Utility of longterm fee estimation]({{bse}}124227)
  Abubakar Sadiq Ismail is seeking feedback from projects, protocols, or users
  that rely on long-term fee estimates for his work on [fee estimation][topic
  fee estimation]. {% assign timestamp="49:31" %}

- [Why are two anchor outputs are used in the LN?]({{bse}}125883)
  Instagibbs provides historical context for the [anchor outputs][topic anchor
  outputs] used currently in Lightning and points out that with changes to
  [Bitcoin Core policies in 28.0][28.0 wallet guide], there is a planned update
  to [v3 commitments][topic v3 commitments]. {% assign timestamp="54:34" %}

- [Why are there no BIPs in the 2xx range?]({{bse}}125914)
  Michael Folkson points out that BIP numbers 200-299 were at some point
  reserved for Lightning-related BIPs. {% assign timestamp="57:19" %}

- [Why doesn't Bech32 use the character "b"?]({{bse}}125902)
  Bordalix answers that the visual similarity between "B" and "8" was the rationale for
  not allowing "B" in the [bech32 and bech32m][topic bech32] address formats. He
  also provides additional trivia around bech32. {% assign timestamp="59:55" %}

- [Bech32 error detection and correction reference implementation]({{bse}}125961)
  Pieter Wuille notes that bech32 can detect up to four errors in address encoding
  and correct two substitution errors. {% assign timestamp="1:00:23" %}

- [How to safely spend/burn dust?]({{bse}}125702)
  Murch lists things to consider when sending [dust][topic
  uneconomical outputs] out of an existing wallet. {% assign timestamp="1:02:48" %}

- [How is the refund transaction in Asymmetric Revocable Commitments constructed?]({{bse}}125905)
  Biel Castellarnau walks through the examples of commitment transactions from the
  Mastering Bitcoin book. {% assign timestamp="1:07:34" %}

- [Which applications use ZMQ with Bitcoin Core?]({{bse}}125920)
  Sjors Provoost is looking for users of Bitcoin Core's ZMQ services as part of
  investigating whether [IPC][news320 ipc] could replace those uses. {% assign timestamp="42:15" %}

## Releases and release candidates

_New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure
projects.  Please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test
release candidates._

- [Bitcoin Core 29.0rc2][] is a release candidate for the next major
  version of the network's predominate full node.  Please see the
  [version 29 testing guide][bcc29 testing guide]. {% assign timestamp="1:08:21" %}

- [LND 0.19.0-beta.rc1][] is a release candidate for this popular LN
  node.  One of the major improvements that could probably use testing
  is the new RBF-based fee bumping for cooperative closes described
  below in the notable code changes section. {% assign timestamp="1:08:55" %}

## Notable code and documentation changes

_Notable recent changes in [Bitcoin Core][bitcoin core repo], [Core
Lightning][core lightning repo], [Eclair][eclair repo], [LDK][ldk repo],
[LND][lnd repo], [libsecp256k1][libsecp256k1 repo], [Hardware Wallet
Interface (HWI)][hwi repo], [Rust Bitcoin][rust bitcoin repo], [BTCPay
Server][btcpay server repo], [BDK][bdk repo], [Bitcoin Improvement
Proposals (BIPs)][bips repo], [Lightning BOLTs][bolts repo],
[Lightning BLIPs][blips repo], [Bitcoin Inquisition][bitcoin inquisition
repo], and [BINANAs][binana repo]._

- [Bitcoin Core #31603][] updates the `ParsePubkeyInner` parser to reject public
  keys with leading or trailing whitespace, matching the parsing behavior of the
  [rust-miniscript][rust miniscript] project.  It shouldn't have been
  possible to accidentally add whitespace previously due to the
  protection of the descriptor checksum. The `getdescriptorinfo` and
  `importdescriptors` RPC commands now throw an error if the public key fragment
  of a [descriptor][topic descriptors] contains such whitespace. {% assign timestamp="45:12" %}

- [Eclair #3044][] increases the default minimum confirmations for channel
  safety against block reorganizations from 6 to 8.  It also removes the scaling of
  this value based on the channel funding amount because channel capacity can be changed
  significantly during [splicing][topic splicing], convincing the node
  to accept a low number of confirmations for what is actually a large
  amount of money at stake. {% assign timestamp="1:09:45" %}

- [Eclair #3026][] adds support for Bitcoin Core wallets using [Pay-to-Taproot
  (P2TR)][topic taproot] addresses, including watch-only wallets managed by
  Eclair, as a basis for implementing [simple taproot channels][topic simple
  taproot channels]. P2WPKH scripts are still required for some mutual close
  transactions, even when using a P2TR wallet. {% assign timestamp="1:10:38" %}

- [LDK #3649][] adds support for paying Lightning Service Providers (LSPs) with
  [BOLT12 offers][topic offers] by adding the necessary fields. Previously, only
  [BOLT11][] and on-chain payment options were enabled. This was also proposed
  in [BLIPs #59][]. {% assign timestamp="1:11:02" %}

- [LDK #3665][] increases the [BOLT11][] invoice size limit from 1,023 bytes to
  7,089 bytes to match LND's limit, which is based on the maximum number
  of bytes that can fit on a QR code.  The PR author argues that QR
  codes compatible with the encoding used in a BOLT11 invoice are
  actually limited to 4,296 characters, but the 7,089 value is chosen
  for LDK because "system-wide consistency is probably more important." {% assign timestamp="1:11:59" %}

- [LND #8453][], [#9559][lnd #9559], [#9575][lnd #9575], [#9568][lnd
  #9568], and [LND #9610][] introduce an [RBF][topic rbf] cooperative
  close flow based on [BOLTs #1205][] (see [Newsletter #342][news342
  closev2]) that
  allows either peer to bump the fee rate using their own channel funds.
  Previously, peers sometimes had to convince their counterparty to pay
  for fee bumps, which often resulted in failed
  attempts. To enable this feature, the `protocol.rbf-coop-close` configuration
  flag must be set.{% assign timestamp="1:14:28" %}

- [BIPs #1792][] updates [BIP119][] which specifies
  [OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY][topic op_checktemplateverify] by revising the
  language for better clarity, removing the activation logic, renaming Eltoo to
  [LN-Symmetry][topic eltoo], and adding mentions of new [covenant][topic
  covenants] proposals and projects like [Ark][topic ark] that use `OP_CTV`. {% assign timestamp="1:16:00" %}

- [BIPs #1782][] reformats the specification section of [BIP94][], which
  outlines the consensus rules of [testnet4][topic testnet], for better clarity
  and readability. {% assign timestamp="1:16:40" %}
