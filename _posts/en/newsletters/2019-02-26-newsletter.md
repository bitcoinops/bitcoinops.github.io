This week's newsletter describes the availability of a libsecp256k1 fork
implementing BIP-Schnorr compatible signatures, lists popular questions
and answers for February from the Bitcoin StackExchange, and describes
notable merges in popular Bitcoin infrastructure projects.

## Action items

None this week.

## News

- **Schnorr-ready fork of libsecp256k1 available:** Blockstream
  cryptographer Andrew Poelstra [announced][schnorr libsecp256k1-zkp]
  that the [libsecp256k1-zkp][] library used in [Elements Project][]
  based sidechains (such as [Liquid][]) now supports [BIP-Schnorr][]
  compatible signatures in a variety of configurations:

    - Basic single pubkeys and signatures.  These are almost identical
      in use to those with Bitcoin's current ECDSA algorithm, although
      signatures are serialized to use about eight fewer bytes and can
      be efficiently verified in batches.

    - [MuSig][] for multiparty signatures.  Onchain, these look
      identical to single pubkeys and signatures but the public keys and
      signatures are generated by a set of
      private keys using a multi-step protocol.  Whereas
      multisig using current Bitcoin Script requires *n* pubkeys
      and *k* signatures for k-of-n multisig security, MuSig can provide the
      same security using just one public key and one signature---reducing
      block chain space, improving verification efficiency, increasing
      privacy, and allowing much larger sets of signers than supported
      by Bitcoin Script's current byte-size and signature-operation
      limits.  But it does have two downsides: the increase in privacy
      also destroys provable accountability---there's no way to know
      which particular authorized signers were part of the subset that
      created a signature---and the multi-step protocol requires
      especially careful management of secret nonces to avoid accidentally
      revealing private keys.  Addressing the second issue, Poelstra's post details
      how libsecp256k1-zkp attempts to minimize the risk of
      nonce-related failures and teases the possibility of even better
      solutions in the future.

    - Adapter signatures for scriptless scripts.  Using a multi-step
      protocol, Alice can prove to Bob that her final signature for
      spending a certain payment will reveal to him a value that will
      satisfy some specified condition.  For example, that value could
      be another signature that will allow Bob himself to claim a
      certain other payment, such as an atomic swap or an LN payment
      commitment.  To everyone besides Alice and Bob, the signature is
      just another valid signature with no special meaning.  This can
      often improve the privacy and efficiency of the onchain parts of
      protocols by removing the need for including special data onchain,
      such as the current use of hashes and hashlocks in atomic swaps
      and LN payment commitments.

    The updated library doesn't make the features available on
    sidechains by itself, but it does provide the code upon which both
    signature generation and verification can be performed---allowing
    developers to build the tools necessary to put Schnorr-based systems
    into production.  It is hoped that the code will receive additional
    review and be ported into the upstream [libsecp256k1][] library for
    eventual use in Bitcoin Core related to a soft fork proposal.  To
    learn more, read the [blog post][schnorr libsecp256k1-zkp] or
    [developer documentation][schnorr docs].

## Selected Q&A from Bitcoin StackExchange

*[Bitcoin StackExchange][bitcoin.se] is one of the first places Optech
contributors look for answers to their questions---or when we have a
few spare moments of time to help curious or confused users.  In
this monthly feature, we highlight some of the top voted questions and
answers made since our last update.*

- [Why does BIP44 have internal and external addresses?]({{bse}}84594)
  External addresses are those you give to other people so that they can
  pay you; internal addresses are those you include in your own
  transactions for receiving change.  Pieter Wuille explains that
  [BIP32][], upon which [BIP44][] is based, encourages using separate
  derivation paths for these keys in case you need to prove to an
  auditor how much money you've received but not how much money you've
  spent (or have left).  By giving the auditor the extended public key
  (xpub) for just the external addresses, he can track your received
  payments but still not receive any direct information about your
  spending or current balance via the change addresses.

- [Taproot and scriptless scripts both use Schnorr, but how are they
  different?]({{bse}}84086) In separate answers, Gregory Maxwell and
  Andrew Chow each describe the differences between these two proposed
  uses of Schnorr-based signatures.  Also includes a description of
  adapter signatures, which can be used to enhance the efficiency and
  privacy of trustless contract protocols.

- [How much of block propagation time is used in verification?]({{bse}}84045)
  Gregory Maxwell explains that it's probably closer to 0% than 1% for
  the normal case, but that it can be much larger for a worst case block
  that was specifically constructed to take a long time to verify.

## Notable code and documentation changes

*Notable changes this week in [Bitcoin Core][bitcoin core repo],
[LND][lnd repo], [C-Lightning][c-lightning repo], [Eclair][eclair repo],
[libsecp256k1][libsecp256k1 repo], and [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals
(BIPs)][bips repo].*

- [Bitcoin Core #15348][] adds a [productivity hints][] document
  describing tools and techniques developers have found to improve their
  efficiency.  Although some are specific to Bitcoin Core and C++
  development, others more generally apply to anyone who develops with
  git or GitHub.

- [C-Lightning #2343][] provides the project's existing documentation in
  a nicer format at [ReadTheDocs.io][cl rtd].

- [C-Lightning #2353][], [#2360][C-Lightning #2360], and
  [#2365][C-Lightning #2365] updates various RPCs to now accept values
  suffixed with "btc", "sat", or "msat" to indicate the denomination of
  the value.  The "btc" value allows up to 11 decimal places and the
  "sat" value up to 3 decimal places but, in both cases, the last three
  of these places must be zeroes for onchain operations where the extra
  precision isn't supported by the Bitcoin protocol.  Other RPCs return
  new fields ending in `_msat` that always contain the millisatoshi
  value.  Several internal API changes are also made.

- [C-Lightning #2380][] requires transactions have at least one
  confirmation before the wallet will attempt to spend their bitcoins by
  default.  This fixes a problem where the wallet would attempt to spend
  its own unconfirmed change outputs but those payments would sometimes
  get stuck because the earlier payments weren't confirming quickly.
  Several RPCs related to payments receive a `minconf` parameter that
  defaults to `1` but can be set to `0` to continue the old behavior or
  set to a higher value if desired.

- [Eclair #821][] improves the heuristics used to help find
  a good route over which to send a payment.
