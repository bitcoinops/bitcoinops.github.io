This week's newsletter looks at an analysis of P2P traffic experienced
by a typical full node, summarizes research into LN pathfinding, and
describes a new approach for creating probabilistic payments.  Also
included are our regular sections summarizing a Bitcoin Core PR Review
Club meeting, announcing new releases and release candidates, and
describing notable changes to popular Bitcoin infrastructure projects.

## News

- **P2P traffic analysis:** developer Virtu [posted][virtu traffic] to
  Delving Bitcoin an analysis of the network traffic generated and
  received by his node in four different modes: initial block download
  (IBD), non-listening (outbound connections only), non-archival (pruned) listening, and archival
  listening.  Although the results for his single node may not have been
  representative in all cases, we found several of his discoveries to be
  interesting:

  - *High block traffic as an archival listening node:* Virtu's node served
    several gigabytes of blocks each hour to other nodes when operating
    as a non-pruned listening node.  Many of the blocks were older blocks
    being requested by incoming connections so that they could perform
    IBD.

  - *High inv traffic as a non-archival listener:* about 20% of total node
    traffic was `inv` messages before he enabled serving of older
    blocks.  [Erlay][topic erlay] may significantly reduce
    that 20% overhead, which represented about 100 megabytes a day.

  - *Bulk of inbound peers appear to be spy nodes:* "Interestingly, the
    bulk of inbound peers exchange only around 1MB of traffic with my
    node, which is too low (using traffic via my outbound connections as
    baseline) for them to be regular connections. All those nodes do is
    complete the P2P handshake, and politely reply to ping messages.
    Other than that, they just suck up our `inv` messages."

  Virtu's post contains additional insights and multiple charts
  illustrating the traffic experienced by his node.

- **Research into single-path LN pathfinding:** Sindura Saraswathi
  [posted][saraswathi path] to Delving Bitcoin about [research][sk path]
  she conducted with Christian KÃ¼mmerle about finding optimal paths
  between LN nodes for sending payments in a single part.  Her post
  describes the strategies currently used by Core Lightning, Eclair,
  LDK, and LND.  The authors then use eight modified and unmodified LN
  nodes in a simulated LN network (based on a snapshot of the actual
  network) to test pathfinding, evaluating criteria such as
  highest success rate, lowest fee ratios (lowest cost), shortest total
  time lock (least bad worst-case waiting period), and shortest path
  (least likely to result in a stuck payment).  No algorithm performed
  better than the others in all cases, and Saraswathi suggests that
  implementations provide better weighting functions that allow users to
  choose the tradeoffs they prefer for different payments (e.g., you may
  prioritize a high success rate for a small in-person purchase but
  prefer a low fee ratio for paying a large monthly bill that isn't due
  for a few more weeks).  She also notes that "[although]  beyond the
  scope of this study, we note that the insights gained in this study
  are also relevant for future improvements in [multi-part
  payment][topic multipath payments] pathfinding algorithms."

- **Probabilistic payments using different hash functions as an xor function:**
  Robin Linus [replied][linus pp] to the Delving Bitcoin thread about
  [probabilistic payments][topic probabilistic payments] with a
  conceptually simple script that allows two parties to each commit to
  an arbitrary amount of entropy that can later be revealed and xored
  together, to produce a value that can be used to determine which one
  of them receives a payment.  Using (and slightly extending) Linus's
  example from the post:

  - Alice privately chooses the value `1 0 0` plus a separate nonce.
    Bob privately chooses the value `1 1 0` plus another
    separate nonce.

  - Each party successively hashes their nonce, with the numbers in
    their value determining which hash function is used.  When the value
    on the top of the stack is `0`, they use the `HASH160` opcode;
    when the value is `1`, they use the `SHA256` opcode.  In Alice's
    case, she performs `sha256(hash160(hash160(alice_nonce)))`; in Bob's
    case, he performs `sha256(sha256(hash160(bob_nonce)))`.  This
    produces a commitment for each of them, which they send to each
    other without revealing either their value or their nonce.

  - With the commitments shared, they create an onchain funding
    transaction with a script that will validate the inputs using
    `OP_IF` to choose between the different hash functions and allows
    one of them to claim the payment.  For example, if the sum of their
    two xored values is 0 or 1, Alice receives the money; if it's 2 or
    3, Bob receives it.  The contract may also have a timeout clause and
    a space-saving mutual-agreement clause.

  - After the funding transaction confirms to a suitable depth, Alice
    and Bob disclose to each other their values and their nonces.  The
    xor of `1 0 0` and `1 1 0` is `0 1 0`, which sums to `1`, allowing
    Alice to claim the payment.

## Bitcoin Core PR Review Club

## Releases and release candidates

_New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure
projects.  Please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test
release candidates._

- [Eclair v0.12.0][] is a major release of this LN node.  It "adds
  support for creating and managing [BOLT12][] offers and a new channel
  closing protocol that supports [RBF][topic rbf].  [It] also adds
  support for storing small amounts of data for our peers" ([peer
  storage][topic peer storage]), among other improvements and bug fixes.
  The release notes mention that several major dependencies have been
  updated, requiring users to make those updates before deploying the
  new version of Eclair.
