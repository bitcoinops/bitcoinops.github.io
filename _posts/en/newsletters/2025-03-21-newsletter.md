This week's newsletter summarizes a discussion about LND's updated
dynamic feerate adjustment system.  Also included are our regular
sections describing recent changes to services and client software,
announcing new releases and release candidates, and summarizing recent
merges to popular Bitcoin infrastructure software.

## News

- **Discussion of LND's dynamic feerate adjustment system:** Matt
  Morehouse [posted][morehouse sweep] to Delving Bitcoin a description
  of LND's recently-rewritten _sweeper_ system, which
  determines the feerates to use for onchain transactions (including
  [RBF][topic rbf] fee bumps).  He begins with a brief description
  of the safety critical aspects of fee management for an LN node, as
  well as the natural desire to avoid overpaying.  He then describes the
  two general strategies used by LND:

  - Querying external feerate estimators, such as a local Bitcoin Core
    node or a third party.  This is mainly used for choosing initial
    feerates and fee bumping non-urgent transactions.

  - Exponential fee bumping, used when a deadline is approaching to
    ensure that problems with a node's mempool or its [fee estimation][topic fee estimation]
    don't prevent timely confirmation.  For example, Eclair uses exponential fee
    bumping when deadlines are within six blocks.

  Morehouse then describes how these two strategies are combined in
  LND's new sweeper system: "[HTLC][topic htlc] claims with matching
  deadlines [are aggregated] into a single [batched transaction][topic
  payment batching]. The budget for the batched transaction is
  calculated as the sum of the budgets for the individual HTLCs in the
  transaction. Based on the transaction budget and deadline, a fee
  function is computed that determines how much of the budget is spent
  as the deadline approaches.  By default, a linear fee function is used,
  which starts at a low fee (determined by the minimum relay fee rate or
  an external estimator) and ends with the total budget being allocated
  to fees when the deadline is one block away."

  He additionally describes how the new logic helps protect against
  [replacement cycling][topic replacement cycling] attacks, concluding:
  "with LNDâ€™s default parameters an attacker must generally spend at
  least 20x the value of the HTLC to successfully carry out a
  replacement cycling attack."  He adds that the new system also
  improves LND's defense against [pinning attacks][topic transaction
  pinning].

  He concludes with a link-filled summary of several "LND-specific bug
  and vulnerability fixes" made through the improved logic.  Abubakar
  Sadiq Ismail [replied][ismail sweep] with some suggestions for how all
  LN implementations (in addition to other software) can more
  effectively use Bitcoin Core's fee estimation.  Several other
  developers also commented, adding both nuance to the description and
  praise for the new approach.
