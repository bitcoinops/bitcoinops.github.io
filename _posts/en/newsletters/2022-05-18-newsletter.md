This week's newsletter summarizes a discussion about the minimum change
to Bitcoin's Script language necessary to enable recursive covenants, examines
a revised proposal to add an `OP_TX` opcode, and reviews research into
adapting output script descriptors for hardware signing devices.  Also
included are our regular sections with the summary of recent changes to
Bitcoin services and clients, new releases and release candidates, and
notable changes to popular Bitcoin infrastructure software.
Additionally, we celebrate the publication of Optech's 200<sup>th</sup>
regular newsletter.

## News

- **When would enabling `OP_CAT` allow recursive covenants?** in a
  discussion on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list about re-adding the
  [OP_CAT][op_cat] opcode removed from Bitcoin in 2010, developer
  ZmnSCPxj [claimed][zmnscpxj cat1] `OP_CAT` needed to be combined with
  proposed opcodes `OP_TX` (see [Newsletter #187][news187 op_tx]),
  [OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK][topic op_checksigfromstack] (CSFS), or a
  similar feature in order for it to enable inescapable recursive
  [covenants][topic covenants]---contracts which use Bitcoin's
  consensus rules to enforce that all bitcoins received to the contract
  can only be spent to the same contract.

    Recursive covenants depend on a technique referred to as
    *transaction introspection* by which an opcode can analyze part of
    the transaction which executes that opcode.  Existing opcodes
    `OP_CHECKSIG`, [BIP65][] `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`, and [BIP112][]
    `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` provide limited introspection.  Proposed
    opcodes TX and CSFS could allow flexible introspection of all parts
    of a transaction, including its next output (the amount of bitcoins
    and the address that's being paid) and its *prevout* (previous
    output, the amount of bitcoins previously received and the script
    currently being used to authorize their spending).

    If an opcode or other script feature is used to ensure the prevout
    and next output are identical, the simplest type of recursive covenant is created.
    However, prevouts aren't directly part of transactions---they must
    be obtained from the block chain---so a copy of a prevout must be
    included in a transaction in order to compare a prevout to the next
    output.  Adding even more complication, the use of hash functions in
    multiple parts of Bitcoin transactions seems to prevent a prevout
    script from being able to directly compare itself to the next output
    script; instead, either the prevout, next output, or both must be
    dynamically constructed from their constituent elements---this is
    what makes the proposed concatenation opcode (CAT) or a similar
    construct necessary for recursive covenants.

    In many cases, the most efficient way prior to [taproot][topic
    taproot] to include a copy of a prevout in a transaction was for it
    to be provided as authorization data similar to a digital signature.
    If the copy of the prevout is provided alongside a signature, it can
    be checked by introspection of the transaction witness, which would
    require a flexible introspection facility such as TX or CSFS.  The
    proposed CTV and APO script changes would also allow introspection
    of a next output, but they're much less able to introspect a
    witness, making it appear that they were unable to create recursive
    covenants even when combined with CAT.

    Nadav Ivgi [replied][ivgi cat] that it's also possible to include a
    copy of the information used to construct the prevout in the prevout
    itself (by adding that information when it's the next output).  When
    creating recursive covenants, this still requires CAT to get around
    problems with hashing, but it means features such as CTV and APO
    that focus on output introspection are also able to create recursive
    covenants in combination with CAT.  When used with the features of
    taproot, Ivgi also thinks verifying prevouts through next outputs
    makes covenant scripts simpler to write and he provides links to two
    interesting example recursive covenants.

    ZmnSCPxj [agreed][zmnscpxj cat2] with Ivgi's analysis and echoed his
    previous concern about the risk of enabling recursive covenants on
    Bitcoin (see [Newsletter #190][news190 recurse]), although he also
    noted in a [subsequent post][zmnscpxj cat3] that "[for what it's
    worth], recursive covenants are probably safe, as they are not in
    fact [Turing-complete][]".

    Russell O'Connor also [cited][oconnor cat] a [post][poelstra cat] by
    Andrew Poelstra (covered in [Newsletter #134][news134 cat])
    describing how CAT by itself is powerful enough in combination with
    already-available Bitcoin features to create non-recursive
    covenants---and, more theoretically, might also be able to create
    recursive covenants by itself if it was added back into Bitcoin.

    All of the discussion was about proposed additions to Bitcoin, so
    there are no changes to our understanding of the currently-deployed
    state of the Bitcoin system.

- **Updated OP_TX proposal:** as described in [Newsletter #187][news187
  op_tx], Rusty Russell proposed an `OP_TX` opcode (based on previous
  proposals) that would allow a [tapscript][topic tapscript] to push to
  the stack selected parts of the transaction executing it.  For
  example, Alice could receive bitcoins to a script containing
  `OP_TX(SELECT_LOCKTIME)` to push the locktime of the spending
  transaction onto the stack.  Using this generic transaction
  introspection feature of TX, Alice could then replicate the specific
  introspection capability of `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` (CLTV), e.g.
  `OP_TX(SELECT_LOCKTIME) <height> OP_GREATERTHAN OP_VERIFY`.

    Using CLTV in the above example case would use fewer vbytes than TX,
    but TX's flexibility could allow examining many other parts of a
    transaction that currently can't be introspected in Bitcoin.  TX
    could also possibly introspect data that's outside of a transaction
    but which is needed by full nodes in order to validate that
    transaction.  As originally proposed, TX was [flagged][rubin op_tx
    recursive] for enabling recursive covenants, which currently appear
    to be controversial (see [Newsletter #190][news190 recov]).

    This week, Russell [proposed][russell op_tx] a restricted version of
    TX that only provides access to the same fields as used by
    [OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY][topic op_checktemplateverify] (CTV) and
    only in the same hash digest format that CTV consumes.
    [BIP119][] CTV was specifically designed not to create recursive
    covenants in combination with any existing Script features, so the
    restricted TX opcode should provide all the same features while also
    not enabling recursive covenants.

    Additionally the restricted TX is designed so that future soft forks
    could easily extend it with additional introspection features,
    including optionally features that enable recursive covenants if
    there was support for adding that capability.  As of this writing,
    two developers suggested uses for TX by extending it with slightly
    more features:

    - *Improved vault primitive:* Russell's proposal suggests an extension that would provide the
      ability to push onto the stack the number of satoshis being spent
      to each output in the transaction.  Brandon Black [suggests][black
      op_tx] that also including the amount of each prevout (input)
      being spent would make it easier to create [vaults][topic vaults].
      Black in particular suggests replicating the capability of the
      `OP_IN_OUT_AMOUNT` opcode from the `OP_TAPLEAF_UPDATE_VERIFY`
      (TLUV) proposal several months ago (see [Newsletter #166][news166
      tluv]).

    - *Using transaction introspection to prevent RBF pinning:* Gregory
      Sanders [noted][sanders op_tx] that the proposed [Eltoo][topic
      eltoo] layer for LN which makes use of the
      [SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT][topic sighash_anyprevout] opcode may be
      vulnerable to [transaction pinning attacks][topic transaction
      pinning] as an interaction with [BIP125][] rule #3 (see
      [Newsletter #27][news27 eltoo]).  Sanders suggests that giving TX
      the ability to push the transaction weight (size) to the stack
      would allow the participants in an eltoo-based payment channel to
      put a limit on the maximum size of a transaction, eliminating as a
      risk one type of pinning that depends on inflating the size of a
      transaction.  This seems conceptually similar to an idea mentioned
      in [Newsletter #191][news191 pinning] for preventing
      [CPFP][topic cpfp] pinning.

- **Adapting miniscript and output script descriptors for hardware signing devices:**
  Salvatore Ingala [posted][ingala desc] to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list
  about his work implementing [output script descriptors][topic
  descriptors] (descriptors) and [miniscript][topic miniscript] for
  hardware signing devices.  He noted that signing devices are
  particularly focused on policy verification---users need to understand
  what will happen if they approve a transaction but they shouldn't be
  prompted for more information than necessary to ensure their funds are
  safe.  Due to the small screen size on many signing devices and the
  difficulty verifying information there, it's also important to display
  information as compactly as possible.  Ingala suggests several
  enhancements to descriptors to address these problems:

    - *Policy registration:* during the setup of a signing device, the
      user should use the device to validate their preferred policy.  For
      devices with persistent storage, the registered policy should be
      saved to the device.  For devices without storage, the device
      should return a cryptographically secure proof of registration
      that may be quickly reloaded along with the policy each time the
      device is started.  The proposal doesn't describe the details of
      how policies should be registered on devices, but it does
      reference [BIP129][] secure multisig setup (see [Newsletter
      #136][news136 sms]).

    - *Key placeholders:* instead of including repeated [BIP32][]
      extended keys in descriptors, Ingala suggests allowing policy to
      define a short placeholder that will be replaced with BIP32
      information when the policy is interpreted.  This can both
      significantly reduce the byte size of policies and also make them
      much more human readable.  Ingala also suggests a few shortcuts
      for commonly used strings in descriptors.

    - *Reduced expressiveness:* only a subset of descriptors is
      supported, although additional features may be added later if
      there is desire for them.  This simplifies implementation.

    The proposal received some discussion on the mailing list as of this
    writing.

## Changes to services and client software

*In this monthly feature, we highlight interesting updates to Bitcoin
wallets and services.*

- **MyCitadel Wallet released:**
  [MyCitadel Wallet][] is a desktop Bitcoin, Lightning, and [RGB][] wallet
  application supporting multisig, [PSBTs][topic psbt], segwit, taproot,
  [timelocks][topic timelocks],
  hardware signing devices, [descriptors][topic descriptors], and other features.

- **Tauros exchange supports Lightning:**
  Mexican exchange [Tauros][] announces Lightning deposit and
  withdraw support.

- **Lightning Multiplexer announced:**
  The Lightning Multiplexer ([lnmux][]) software, supporting LND, improves Lightning payment
  reliability by allowing for fail-over scenarios for incoming payments. More
  details are available on the [Bottlepay blog post][lnmux blog].

- **Coldcard adds taproot sends:**
  The [latest Coldcard firmware][coldcard upgrade] (Mk4 5.0.3, Mk3 4.1.5) support sending to
  [bech32m][topic bech32] addresses.

## Releases and release candidates

*New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure
projects.  Please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test
release candidates.*

- [LND 0.15.0-beta.rc1][] is a release candidate for the next major
  version of this popular LN node.

## Notable code and documentation changes

*Notable changes this week in [Bitcoin Core][bitcoin core repo], [Core
Lightning][core lightning repo], [Eclair][eclair repo], [LDK][ldk repo],
[LND][lnd repo], [libsecp256k1][libsecp256k1 repo], [Hardware Wallet
Interface (HWI)][hwi repo], [Rust Bitcoin][rust bitcoin repo], [BTCPay
Server][btcpay server repo], [BDK][bdk repo], [Bitcoin Improvement
Proposals (BIPs)][bips repo], and [Lightning BOLTs][bolts repo].*

- [Bitcoin Core #22235][] adds a script that will generate an example
  `bitcoin.conf` file directly from the source code defining the configuration
  options. This change allows future Bitcoin Core releases to have a
  pre-installed bitcoin.conf file without creating a second source of truth on
  the state of configuration options.

- [LND #6450][] adds support for signing [PSBTs][topic psbt] that spend
  [taproot][topic taproot] outputs.

- [LND #6345][] allows LND to get updates about new transactions and
  blocks by repeatedly polling Bitcoin Core rather than receiving push
  updates from it via ZMQ.

- [BIPs #1309][] updates [BIP119][]'s example implementation of
  [OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY][topic op_checktemplateverify].  The previous
  example contained the code implementing the opcode for Bitcoin Core,
  which is written in C++.  The new example is written in pseudo-python.
  Extra information is also added about how to avoid a potential
  denial-of-service attack possible in a naive implementation,
  addressing a concern previously discussed on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing
  list (see [Newsletter #183][news183 dos]).

## Celebrating Optech Newsletter #200

Every fifty newsletters, we take a moment to highlight some of Optech's
major accomplishments.  We do this in part to help readers learn about
all we have to offer and in part to help attract donations that allow us
to continue producing useful resources.  But, at least a little bit, we
also do it to brag.

We don't brag out of personal vanity but because each contributor to
Optech is themselves a huge fan of the other contributors.  Working with
amazing people as a team is a wonderful experience and these special
newsletter sections are usually where we get to put into print some of
our unreserved admiration for each other.

That's not what we're doing this year.  Instead, we wanted to give you,
the readers, your own chance to share some of your admiration for
Optech's contributors.  Without even soliciting comments, we found
dozens and then hundreds of lovely things said by our readers on
Twitter.  There were too many incredible comments to reasonably print,
so we limited ourselves to the top {{page.praise | size}} from the past
four years.

You'll find the comments below, but first we want to thank our main
contributors from the past year---Adam Jonas, Carl Dong, David A.
Harding, Gloria Zhao, John Newbery, Mark Erhardt, Mike Schmidt, and
Shigeyuki Azuchi---and also thank our [many supporters][supporters],
including our [founding sponsors][] Wences Casares, John Pfeffer, and
Alex Morcos.
