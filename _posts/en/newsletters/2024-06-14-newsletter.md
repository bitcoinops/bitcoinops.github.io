This week's newsletter announces a draft BIP for a quantum-safe Bitcoin
address format and includes our regular sections with the summary of a
Bitcoin Core PR Review Club, announcements of new releases and release
candidates, and descriptions of notable changes to popular Bitcoin
infrastructure projects.

## News

- **Draft BIP for quantum-safe address format:** developer Hunter Beast
  [posted][beast post] to both Delving Bitcoin and the mailing list a
  ["rough draft" BIP][quantum draft] for assigning version 3 segwit
  addresses to a [quantum-resistant][topic quantum resistance] signature
  algorithm.  The draft BIP describes the problem and links to several
  potential algorithms along with their expected onchain size.  The
  choice of algorithms and the specific implementation details are
  left for future discussion, as are additional BIPs necessary to fully
  realize the vision of adding full quantum resistance to Bitcoin.

## Bitcoin Core PR Review Club

*In this monthly section, we summarize a recent [Bitcoin Core PR Review
Club][] meeting, highlighting some of the important questions and

## Releases and release candidates

*New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure
projects.  Please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test
release candidates.*

- [Core Lightning 24.05][] is a release of the next major version of
  this popular LN node implementation.  It includes improvements that
  help it better work with a pruned full node (see [Newsletter
  #300][news300 cln prune]), allows the `check` RPC to work with plugins
  (see [Newsletter #302][news302 cln check]), stability improvements
  (such as those described in Newsletters [#303][news303 cln chainlag]
  and [#304][news304 cln feemultiplier]), allows more robust delivery of
  [offer][topic offers] invoices (see [Newsletter #304][news304 cln
  offers]), and a fix for a fee overpayment issue when the
  `ignore_fee_limits` configuration option is used (see [Newsletter
  #306][news306 cln overpay]).

- [Bitcoin Core 27.1][] is a maintenance release of the predominant
  full node implementation.  It contains multiple bug fixes.

FIXME:Gustavojfe

- [Bitcoin Core #29496][] policy: bump TX_MAX_STANDARD_VERSION to 3

- [Bitcoin Core #28307][] rpc, wallet: fix incorrect segwit redeem script size limit

- [Bitcoin Core #30047][] refactor: Model the bech32 charlimit as an Enum ; mainly just looking for a quick mention that this is being done for silent payments -harding

- [Bitcoin Core #28979][] wallet, rpc: document and update `sendall` behavior around unconfirmed inputs

- [Eclair #2854][] and [LDK #3083][] both related to [BOLTs #1163][]

- [LND #8491][] invoice_cltv_expiry

- [LDK #3080][] Optional compact blinded path creation

- [LDK #3072][] Reintroduce addresses to NodeAnnouncementInfo. ; this
  might not be notable - fell free to delete if your research indicates
  it's just something minor -harding

- [BIPs #1551][] Add BIPâ€¯353: DNS Payment Instructions
