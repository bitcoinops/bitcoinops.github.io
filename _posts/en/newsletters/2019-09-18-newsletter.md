## News

- **Conference talk summaries:** last week's Scaling Bitcoin conference
  and Edge Dev++ training sessions yielded several interesting talks
  which we've summarized in two special sections later in this
  newsletter.

## Bitcoin Edge Dev++

The Scaling Bitcoin conference was preceded by the community-organized
Bitcoin Edge Dev++ training sessions.  Recordings of the sessions are
expected to be made public in the near future, but [transcripts][edge
dev ts] typed by Bryan Bishop are available now.  We suggest at least
skimming all of the topics, but we found the following transcripts
both novel and interesting:

- [Bitcoin Core rebroadcasting logic][uttarwar rebroadcast] by Amiti
  Uttarwar describes her work to eliminate a privacy leak in Bitcoin
  Core's wallet.  If the first send of a wallet transaction doesn't
  result in reasonably fast confirmation, the wallet will rebroadcast
  the transaction in order to ensure it is relayed to miners.  However,
  there's no other case where a full node will rebroadcast a
  transaction it sent previously, so spy nodes can assume any node
  rebroadcasting a transaction is operated by the user who created that
  transaction.  Worse, this behavior can be actively exploited by
  sending a tiny payment with a low fee to an address whose owner you
  want to identify and waiting for their wallet to rebroadcast the
  transaction.

    Uttarwar's proposed solution is having the node treat all
    transactions the same, rebroadcasting any of them when a heuristic
    indicates they should've been mined recently but weren't.  This
    prevents spy nodes from being able to assume that the node which
    rebroadcast a transaction is operated by the creator of that
    transaction.  The presentation concluded with an overview of some
    edge cases, an insight from Uttarwar's experience developing for
    Bitcoin Core, and a short list of open questions for future
    research.  See [Bitcoin Core #16698][] for the first of Uttarwar's
    PRs implementing these mitigations.

- [Blockchain design patterns: Layers and scaling approaches][pv patterns]
  by Andrew Poelstra and David Vorick briefly describes a long
  list of existing and proposed technologies for making effective use of
  a space-limited block chain.  Starting with existing features, they
  begin by comparing Bitcoin's UTXO model to Ethereum's balance model,
  finding that the spend-once nature of UTXOs greatly simplifies both
  security analysis and cache-based performance improvements.  This
  effective caching is the basis of technologies such as
  bandwidth-reducing [BIP152][] compact blocks, latency-reducing
  [FIBRE][], and many CPU- and memory-reducing improvements within node
  software.  Yet, Poelstra and Vorick note that the overall best way to
  reduce bandwidth, latency, CPU, and memory is to minimize the use of
  global state in the first place by looking for opportunities to use
  offchain protocols based on unbroadcast transactions, replacements of
  those unbroadcast transactions to allow state transitions, and hash
  locks to create dependencies between different transactions.

    Looking at proposed technology, the presenters explain how the
    bandwidth overhead for relaying transactions grows linearly in the
    current protocol as you increase the number of your peers; this can
    be made almost constant with the proposed [erlay][] protocol,
    allowing you to have many more peers, which reduces the risk of network
    partitioning attacks.  Moving on to describing various parts of the
    taproot proposal, they show how schnorr signatures make it possible
    to validate multiple signatures at once (batch validation) and
    combine several public keys and signatures into a single pubkey and
    signature (signature aggregation), reducing the costs of general
    block validation and the specific costs for multisig users.  Schnorr
    also makes it possible to create adaptor signatures that can provide
    the benefits of both a signature and a hash lock at the same time
    and for only the cost of one.  Finally, taproot can commit to a set
    of conditions without requiring any party to reveal those conditions
    unless they need them, which they might not if their protocol allows
    them to use schnorr multiparty signatures instead.  Each of these
    techniques, individually or in combination, can help users keep more
    data offchain.

    The final part of their talk examines more speculative technology,
    such as improvements to LN using [eltoo][], the minimization of
    storage requirements using [utreexo][], [client side
    validation][todd client side] which keeps almost all data offchain,
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based block chains that allow more
    frequent block production, confidential transactions that hide
    payment amounts, and sharding in both the form of federated block
    chains (available now) and other models that are more speculative.

- [Lightning network topology][kc topology] by Carla Kirk-Cohen
  describes the public topology of channels between LN nodes at present,
  what factors influenced that shape, and what we might be able to do to
  reshape it.  She starts by noting the existence of private channels
  between some nodes that aren't reflected in public data, and then
  outlines the current public network: "5600 nodes, about 35,218 public
  channels, and 959 public BTC sitting in those channels."  Many
  channels, including high-value channels, connect at one end to just a few popular
  nodes, such as the LNbig node which has about "20-24% of the liquidity
  of the LN in their channels."

    Looking at how we arrived at this hub-and-spoke type of topology,
    Kirk-Cohen notes the attractiveness of well-known nodes in the early
    network when all connections were made manually, then the
    attractiveness of well-connected nodes to the early LND autopilot,
    and finally the ongoing attractiveness of popular liquidity
    providers for people who want to receive or route payments.

    Possible improvements discussed involve leveraging various graph
    metrics to help autopilots choose channels that are well-connected
    but not necessarily hubs (such as nodes that are one hop away from a
    hub).  Additionally, she has been working on a scoring system for
    when to *close* a channel and so make your funds available for
    opening a channel to a more effective peer.  Finally, she notes that
    changing channel connections costs onchain fees, so it's not
    practical to make sudden changes to the topology; any changes are
    likely to be applied slowly over time as channels are opened and
    closed organically, so we may have to wait a long time to see
    what effect changes have.

## Scaling Bitcoin

The sixth Scaling Bitcoin conference was held in Tel Aviv, Israel,
September 11th and 12th.  Many of the topics and discussions focused on
subjects we've already covered at length in the newsletter (such as
[Erlay][], [COSHV][], [signet][signet progress], [miniscript][], and
[bitcoin vaults][]).  Of the remaining topics [transcribed][sb ts] by Bryan
Bishop, we found the following topic particularly interesting:

- **TxProbe: discovering Bitcoin's network topology using orphan transactions**
  presented by Sergi Delgado-Segura ([video][vid txprobe],
  [transcript][ts txprobe], [paper][paper txprobe]) describes the
  advantages and disadvantages of being able to determine Bitcoin's
  network topology---which nodes connect to which other
  nodes---something Bitcoin Core tries to prevent.  Delgado-Segura then
  discloses a novel technique he and his co-authors developed for
  probing the network to determine its topology, a combination of using
  orphan transactions (child transactions received before at least one
  of their parents) and a method for temporarily delaying the relay of
  transactions between peers.  The talk illustrates some of the
  challenges of keeping Bitcoin secure and private at the P2P network
  level.

    Although not described in detail during the talk, but perhaps worth
    mentioning here, are the mitigations Bitcoin Core developers have
    deployed as a result of the paper.  The first of these was Bitcoin
    Core [PR#14626][Bitcoin Core #14626], released as part of 0.18.0,
    which made orphan transactions less effective for probing (i.e., it
    fixes the problem described in section 4.3 of the TxProbe paper).
    [PR#14897][Bitcoin Core #14897], described in [Newsletter
    #33][pr14897] with follow-up in Newsletters [#43][pr15839] and
    [#51][pr15834], provided a second and much more significant
    mitigation by eliminating the ability of a third-party to delay
    transaction propagation across the entire network (the *invblock*
    technique described in section 4.2 of the paper as well as a
    [previously published paper][coinscope] by some of the same
    co-authors).  A third mitigation was [PR#15759][Bitcoin Core #15759],
    described in [last week's newsletter][pr15759], which adds two outbound
    connections to each node that only relay blocks---making those two
    connections fundamentally resistant against transaction probing.
    These second and third mitigations are expected to be included in
    the upcoming Bitcoin Core 0.19 release.

    Although several of the specific probing methods described in the
    presentation are being addressed, anyone interested in learning more
    about how nodes form a network and relay information should consider
    perusing the presentation or its paper.

## Notable code and documentation changes

*Notable changes this week in [Bitcoin Core][bitcoin core repo],
[LND][lnd repo], [C-Lightning][c-lightning repo], [Eclair][eclair repo],
[libsecp256k1][libsecp256k1 repo], [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals
(BIPs)][bips repo], and [Lightning BOLTs][bolts repo].*

- [Bitcoin Core #16680][] adds a `-chain` configuration parameter that
  allows the user to select which block chain to use.  This currently
  supports "main" (mainnet), "test" (testnet), and "regtest".  The later
  two chain names can currently be selected using the `-testnet` or
  `-regtest` parameters, but adding a generic function simplifies the
  introduction of additional chains later (e.g. using the signet
  code described in [Newsletter #56][signet progress]).

- [Bitcoin Core #16787][] extends the `getpeerinfo` and `getnetworkinfo`
  RPCs with a new field that decodes the services bitfield which
  indicates what services the peer or local node offer.  This is in
  addition to a previous field that provided the bitfield itself.  For example,
  the bitfield `000000000000040d` decodes to
  `["NETWORK", "BLOOM", "WITNESS", "NETWORK_LIMITED"]`.

- [Bitcoin Core #16725][] now omits the inferred `addresses` field from
  decoded transactions for P2PK outputs.  P2PK outputs---payments
  directly to a pubkey---have never had an address format but the
  RPC interface previously returned the P2PKH address for that pubkey,
  confusing some users and developers.

- [Bitcoin Core #16714][] updates the GUI first-time wizard with an
  option to enable block data pruning.  The default value in the wizard depends on the
  available disk space, with pruning enabled by default if the user
  doesn't have enough space to store the estimated block chain size plus
  10 GB.

- [Bitcoin Core #16285][] extends the `scantxoutset` results with
  `height` and `bestblock` fields so that it's possible to determine
  what chainstate was scanned.

- [Bitcoin Core #15584][] disables support for the [BIP70][] payment
  protocol by default.  It can be re-enabled by compiling with the
  `--enabled-bip70` configure parameter.  See our previous description
  in [Newsletter #19][pr14451] for several reasons why developers
  favor disabling BIP70 support.

- [LND #3282][] allows building LND as a mobile library for Android and
  iOS.  Other programs can include the library and access LND over its
  regular gRPC interface.  For details, see the [mobile readme][].

- [LND #3485][] removes the ability to upgrade from more than one major
  release in the past, simplifying the database migration code and
  allowing testing to focus on fewer upgrade paths.  You can still
  upgrade older versions of LND by upgrading in steps (e.g., 0.5.2-beta
  → 0.6-beta → 0.7-beta → 0.7.1-beta).

- [C-Lightning #2945][] makes new `sendpay_success` and `sendpay_failure`
  notifications available to plugins.

- [C-Lightning #3010][] implements experimental support for [BOLT3][]
  `option_static_remotekey`, allowing C-Lightning to honor the request
  from a channel peer to always pay the same public key for it rather
  than deriving a new key for it.  This makes it easy for the remote
  peer to spend that money even if it loses some channel state.  This
  option is only enabled if C-Lightning is compiled with experimental
  features enabled.
