  version of this popular LN implementation. {% assign timestamp="28:32" %}

## Notable code and documentation changes

*Notable changes this week in [Bitcoin Core][bitcoin core repo], [Core
Lightning][core lightning repo], [Eclair][eclair repo], [LDK][ldk repo],
[LND][lnd repo], [libsecp256k1][libsecp256k1 repo], [Hardware Wallet
Interface (HWI)][hwi repo], [Rust Bitcoin][rust bitcoin repo], [BTCPay
Server][btcpay server repo], [BDK][bdk repo], [Bitcoin Improvement
Proposals (BIPs)][bips repo], and [Lightning BOLTs][bolts repo].*

- [LND #7448][] adds a new rebroadcaster interface to resubmit
  unconfirmed transactions especially to address transactions that were
  evicted from mempools. When enabled, the rebroadcaster will submit
  unconfirmed transactions to the attached full node once per block
  until it is confirmed. LND was already rebroadcasting transactions in
  a similar fashion when operating in Neutrino-mode. As noted in a
  previously covered Stack Exchange Q&A, [Bitcoin Core currently
  does not rebroadcast transactions][no rebroadcast], although it would
  be desirable for privacy and reliability if full node behavior were
  amended to rebroadcast any transactions that the node had expected to
  have been included in the prior block. Until then, it is the responsibility
  of every wallet to ensure the presence of transactions of interest in
  mempools. {% assign timestamp="29:16" %}

- [BDK #793][] is a major restructuring of the library based on the work
  of the [bdk_core sub-project][].  According to the PR description, it
  "maintains the existing wallet API as much as possible and adds very
  little."  Three API endpoints with seemingly minor changes are listed in the PR
  description. {% assign timestamp="36:03" %}
