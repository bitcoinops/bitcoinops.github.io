This week's newsletter includes our regular sections with the best
questions and answers of the past month from the Bitcoin Stack Exchange,
our latest column about preparing for taproot, a list of new software
releases and release candidates, and descriptions of notable changes to
popular Bitcoin infrastructure software.

## News

*No significant news this week.*

## Selected Q&A from Bitcoin Stack Exchange

*[Bitcoin Stack Exchange][bitcoin.se] is one of the first places Optech
contributors look for answers to their questions---or when we have a
few spare moments to help curious or confused users.  In
this monthly feature, we highlight some of the top-voted questions and
answers posted since our last update.*

- [What is this unusual transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain?]({{bse}}107603)
  Murch describes an output labeled "UNKNOWN" in a [block explorer][topic
  block explorers]. The output is a segwit version 1 output with a contrived
  pubkey. As pointed out by 0xb10c, the 2019 transaction creating this output was for
  the purpose of testing segwit v1 support for [Optech's Compatibility
  Matrix][compat matrix]. As warned previously (see [Newsletter #158][news158
  taproot]), P2TR outputs are anyone-can-spend before the activation of taproot, as 0xb10c demonstrated and [elaborates in a blog post][0xB10C blog].

- [What are miners signalling for when the block header nversion field ends in 4 i.e. 0x3fffe004?]({{bse}}107443)
  While researching the overt form of ASICBoost, user shikaridota wonders why
  recently mined blocks have bit 2 being set in the `nVersion` field. Andrew
  Chow points out that [taproot][topic taproot] used bit 2 to signal for activation as specified in [BIP341's
  deployment][bip341 deployment] section.

- [Where can I find Bitcoin's alpha version with 15 minute block time intervals?]({{bse}}107407)
  Andrew Chow points to a [selection of source code][bitcointalk 15min],
  allegedly from Satoshi, which contains 15 minute block times as well as 30 day
  retargeting periods.

- [What's the purpose of using Guix within Gitian? Doesn't that reintroduce dependencies and security concerns?]({{bse}}107638)
  Andrew Chow and fanquake describe the benefits of reproducible builds,
  including using [Gitian builds][github gitian builds] and [bootstrappable
  builds using Guix][github contrib guix] and comment on using them together.

- [Why are there several round number transactions with no change?]({{bse}}107418)
  Shm asks about a series of related transactions that have many inputs with a
  single round-number output with no change. Murch answers by describing [change
  avoidance][bitcoin wiki change avoidance] in the context of a wallet with a
  large number of UTXOs. Change avoidance allows for smaller transactions,
  reduced future fees, UTXO consolidation, and privacy improvements.

## Preparing for taproot #6: learn taproot by using it

*A weekly [series][series preparing for taproot] about how developers
and service providers can prepare for the upcoming activation of taproot
at block height {{site.trb}}.*

## Releases and release candidates

*New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure
projects.  Please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test
release candidates.*

- [Rust Bitcoin 0.27.0][] (bech32m support) is a new release.  Most
  notably, it adds support for handling [bech32m][topic bech32]
  addresses.

- [C-Lightning 0.10.1rc1][C-Lightning 0.10.1] is a release candidate for
  an upgrade that contains a number of new features, several bug fixes,
  and a few updates to developing protocols (including [dual
  funding][topic dual funding] and [offers][topic offers]).

## Notable code and documentation changes

*Notable changes this week in [Bitcoin Core][bitcoin core repo],
[C-Lightning][c-lightning repo], [Eclair][eclair repo], [LND][lnd repo],
[Rust-Lightning][rust-lightning repo], [libsecp256k1][libsecp256k1
repo], [Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI)][hwi repo],
[Rust Bitcoin][rust bitcoin repo], [BTCPay Server][btcpay server repo],
[Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)][bips repo], and [Lightning
BOLTs][bolts repo].*

- [Bitcoin Core #22387][] limits the average number of announced
  addresses it'll process from each peer to one per 10 seconds.  Any
  addresses in excess of the limit will be ignored.  It's possible to
  whitelist peers to allow them to exceed this limit, and any address
  announcements the node explicitly requests from its peers are also
  excluded from the limit.  The limit is estimated to be about four times
  higher than the current rate at which a Bitcoin Core node announces
  addresses.

- [C-Lightning #4669][] fixes several bugs in its [LN offers][topic offers]
  parsing and validation logic.  It also returns a previously created
  offer that hasn't yet expired if the user attempts to create a new
  offer with the same parameters; this may be especially useful since
  offers aren't created by default with an expiration date.

- [C-Lightning #4639][] adds experimental support for the liquidity
  advertisements proposed in [BOLTs #878][].  This allows a node to
  use the LN gossip protocol to advertise its willingness to lease out
  its funds for a period of time, giving other nodes the ability to buy
  incoming capacity that allows them to receive instant payments.
  A node that sees the advertisement can simultaneously pay for and
  receive the incoming capacity using a [dual funded][topic dual
  funding] channel open.  Although there's no way to enforce that the
  advertising node actually routes payments, the proposal does
  incorporate an earlier [proposal][zmn liquidity providers] also
  planned<!-- [1] --> to be used in [Lightning Pool][] that prevents the
  advertiser from using their money for other purposes until the agreed
  upon lease period has concluded, so refusing to route would only deny
  them the opportunity to earn routing fees.  The following table
  compares liquidity advertisements to the similar Lightning Pool
  marketplace described in [Newsletter #123][news123 lightning pool].

- [BIPs #1072][] merges the informational [BIP48][] titled "Multi-Script Hierarchy
  for Multi-Sig Wallets". The document describes a widely deployed derivation
  standard for wallets participating in multisignature setups based on the
  `m/48'` prefix, and elaborates on the six derivation levels
  used by the scheme.

- [BIPs #1139][] adds [BIP371][] with a specification of new fields for
  using [PBSTs][topic psbt] (both [version 0][BIP174] and [version
  2][BIP370]) with [taproot][topic taproot] transactions.  See
  [Newsletter #155][news155 tr psbts] for previous discussion.

## Acknowledgments and edits

Our original description of Bitcoin Core PR #22387 claimed the new rate
limit was about 40x higher than the measured rate.  The correct figure
is about 4x.  We thank Amiti Uttarwar for reporting this error.
