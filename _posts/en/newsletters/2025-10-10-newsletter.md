This week's newsletter describes research into tradeoffs between usability and
security in threshold signatures, summarizes an approach to convert nested
threshold signatures into a single-layer signing group, and examines the
extent to which data could be embedded in the UTXO set under a restrictive set
of rules. Also included are our regular sections summarizing a Bitcoin Core PR
Review Club meeting, announcing new releases and release candidates, and
describing notable changes to popular Bitcoin infrastructure projects.
