This week's newsletter includes our regular sections summarizing
discussion about changing Bitcoin's consensus rules, announcing new
release and release candidates, and describing notable changes to
popular Bitcoin infrastructure software.

## News

_No significant news this week was found in any of our [sources][optech sources]._

## Changing consensus

_A monthly section summarizing proposals and discussion about changing
Bitcoin's consensus rules._

- **Details about the design of Simplicity:** Russell O'Connor made
  three posts ([1][sim1], [2][sim2], [3][sim3]) so far to Delving
  Bitcoin about "the philosophy and design of the [Simplicity
  language][topic simplicity]."  The posts examine "the three major
  forms of composition for transforming basic operations into complex
  operations," "Simplicityâ€™s type system, combinators, and basic
  expressions," and "how to build logical operations starting from bits
  [...up to...] cryptographic operations, such as SHA-256 and Schnorr
  signature validation, using just our computational Simplicity
  combinators."

  The most recent post indicates further entries in the series are
  expected.

- **Draft BIP for adding elliptic curve operations to tapscript:**
  Olaoluwa Osuntokun [posted][osuntokun ec] to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing
  list a link to a [draft BIP][osuntokun bip] for adding several opcodes
  to [tapscript][topic tapscript] that will allow elliptic curve
  operations to be performed on the script evaluation stack.  The
  opcodes are intended to be used in combination with introspection
  opcodes to create or enhance [covenant][topic covenants] protocols in
  addition to other advances.

  Jeremy Rubin [replied][rubin ec1] to suggest additional opcodes to
  enable additional features, as well as [other opcodes][rubin ec2] that
  would make it more convenient to use some features provided by the
  base proposal.

- **Draft BIP for OP_TWEAKADD:** Jeremy Rubin [posted][rubin ta1] to the
  Bitcoin-Dev mailing list a link a [draft BIP][rubin bip] to add
  `OP_TWEAKADD` to [tapscript][topic tapscript].  He separately
  [posted][rubin ta2] notable examples of scripts enabled by the
  addition of the opcode, which include a script to reveal a
  [taproot][topic taproot] tweak, proof of order of signing a
  transaction (e.g., Alice must have signed before Bob), and [signing
  delegation][topic signer delegation].

## Releases and release candidates

_New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure
projects.  Please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test
release candidates._

- [Core Lightning v25.09][] is a release of a new major
  version of this popular LN node implementation.  It adds support to
  the `xpay` command for paying [BIP353][] addresses and simple
  [offers][topic offers], offers improved bookkeeper support, provides
  better plugin dependency management, and includes other new features
  and bug fixes.

- [Bitcoin Core 29.1rc2][] is a release candidate for a maintenance
  version of the predominant full node software.
