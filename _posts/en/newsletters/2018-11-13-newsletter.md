This week's newsletter summarizes a few discussions on the Lightning-Dev
mailing list, suggests an opportunity to develop a new tool some users would
find helpful, and provides summaries and links to some of the talks at the
recent Chaincode Lightning Applications residency.  Several notable code
changes in popular Bitcoin infrastructure projects are also described.

## Action items

None this week.

## News

- **LN developer summit and mailing list activity:** before, during, and
  after a planned meeting among Lightning Network protocol developers,
  the [Lightning-Dev mailing list][] saw a surge of new proposals and
  discussion about earlier proposals.  Below are some highlights:

    - **Advertising node liquidity:** Lisa Neigut [proposes][neigut
      liquidity] allowing LN nodes advertise that they're willing to
      provide incoming capacity in exchange for a certain level of fees.
      Merchants need their payment channels to have incoming capacity in
      order to be able receive secure offchain payments from
      customers---the current alternatives are either requiring some of
      their customers to wait for several onchain confirmations to open
      a new channel or making manual channel liquidity arrangements with
      other merchants.  Although solving this problem would be highly
      advantageous for merchant adoption of LN, it does pose some
      technical challenges that discussion participants attempt to solve
      both in this thread and in a [related thread][zmn liquidity].

    - **Making path probing more convenient:** Anthony Towns
      [proposes][probe cancel] a method for allowing all the nodes along
      a path to forget about a small-value payment if one of the nodes
      on the path is offline.  This reduces the resources required in
      the case of a routing failure by a node that proactively probes
      its available payment paths to determine which are the fastest and
      most reliable for sending payments.

- **Opportunity available for providing utility functions outside of Bitcoin Core:**
  Bitcoin Core's RPC interface currently provides over
  100 methods and there are often proposals to add even more for utility
  functions that don't require access to the internal state of the node
  or wallet.  During last week's developer IRC [meeting][core dev
  meeting], members of the project reaffirmed their commitment to not
  provide any new utility functions for things that can just as easily
  be done outside Bitcoin Core and that are unrelated to normal user
  workflows.  This will help keep the project focused on its main
  objectives.

    This does provide a nice opportunity for an independent developer or
    other third-party to create a separate project for a library, local
    program, or RPC interface that provides a stable interface to
    utility functions that work well in conjunction with Bitcoin Core,
    and which perhaps even provides some of the utility functions that
    Bitcoin Core already supports for users not running a node.  Some
    ideas for how to implement such a tool were discussed both during
    and [after][core dev log] the meeting.

## Lightning Application Residency Videos

As reported previously in [newsletter #19][], Chaincode Labs recently hosted a
five-day [residency program][] for developing applications on the Lightning
Network, including presentations from experts in the space. Videos of the
[presentations][] and [resident demos][] have now been posted online, along
with the slide decks for the expert presentations. The following
talks may be of particular interest to members:

- [**The Lightning Protocol - an Application Developers Perspective**][bosworth
  video] - [Alex Bosworth][bosworth], infrastructure lead at Lightning Labs,
  gives a comprehensive overview of the Lightning protocol, explaining all of the
  [BOLTs][], and how they are relevant for developers building on top of the
  protocol. This talk should be useful for any developers wanting to integrate
  Lightning into products or services.

- [**Lightning â‰ˆ Bitcoin**][decker video] - [Christian Decker][decker], Core Tech
  Engineer at Blockstream, describes the similarities and differences between
  Bitcoin and Lightning payments, highlighting where on-chain transactions are
  more appropriate then off-chain (and vice versa). He finishes with a summary
  of enhancements that may be proposed at the November 2018 Lightning protocol
  meeting.

- [**Integrating Lightning into Bitrefill**][camarena video] - [Justin
  Camarena][camarena], infrastructure engineer at bitrefill, explains how
  bitrefill integrated lightning payments into their store. Bitrefill was
  one of the first Bitcoin merchants to start accepting mainnet Lightning
  payments, and Justin shows us how they integrated Lightning into their
  infrastructure, and the challenges they met and overcame along the way.
  For those interested in a high level overview of bitrefill's experience
  with Lightning, the [talk by Sergej Kotliar at Building on Bitcoin][kotliar
  BoB], covered in [newsletter #3][] will also be of interest.

- [**Zap - UX, Design and Product approach**][mallers video] -
  [Jack Mallers][mallers], founder of Zap, explains his approach to product
  design and user experience. Lightning can potentially solve a lot of user
  experience issues associated with using Bitcoin, but also brings up some user
  experience challenges of its own. Jack explains how he thinks about user
  experience in Zap, the UX challenges he's faced building the product and how
  he's solved them.

## Notable code changes

*Notable code changes this week in [Bitcoin Core][core commits],
[LND][lnd commits], [C-lightning][cl commits], and [libsecp256k1][secp
commits].*

- [Bitcoin Core #14410][] adds an `ischange` field to the
  [getaddressinfo][rpc getaddressinfo] RPC indicating whether the wallet
  used the address in a change output.

- [Bitcoin Core #14060][] makes configurable the maximum number of
  messages the [ZeroMQ][] (ZMQ) interface will queue for a client.  The
  default High-Water Mark (HWM) allows up to 1,000 messages to be queued
  before some messages are dropped.  A new HWM may be chosen by setting
  one of the following configuration options to the desired maximum
  number of queued messages (or the maximum queue size may be made
  unlimited by setting it to `0`): `zmqpubhashtxhwm`,
  `zmqpubhashblockhwm`, `zmqpubrawblockhwm`, and `zmqpubrawtxhwm`.
  The greater the queue size, the more memory the program will use.

- [LND #1782][] adds a `num_inactive_channels` field to the `getinfo` RPC
  with the number of the node's inactive channels (similar to the
  existing counts of pending and active channels).

- [LND #1944][] adds a `pub_key` field to the `sendtoroute` RPC so that
  LND doesn't need to get the pubkey from an external source.  This
  allows routing payments through private channels that are not listed
  on the public network.
