Today we’re announcing our new project, Bitcoin Operations Technology Group
(Optech). We want to help Bitcoin companies adopt the best scaling techniques
and technologies available to make efficient use of the blockchain, and
thereby help Bitcoin to scale to more users and use cases.

We’re calling the project Bitcoin Operations Technology Group because we want
to focus on operational technical work, such as segwit usage, transaction
batching, fee estimation and coin selection. We’re as excited about Lightning,
Schnorr signatures, Taproot/Graftroot and scriptless scripts as any other
Bitcoin engineers, but the project’s focus is on technology that can be
deployed by companies today. As new technologies mature, we will help companies
adopt and integrate them.

We’re really excited about our new initiative and hope that we can do our part
to contribute to a more collaborative atmosphere in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

With generous support from Wences Casares, John Pfeffer and Chaincode Labs,
we've spent the last few months meeting engineers and managers from across the
ecosystem; started producing [weekly newsletters][newsletters] for Bitcoin
engineers highlighting ways that they could use the blockchain more
effectively; and organized our first [workshop][workshop] in San Francisco,
bringing together engineers from exchanges, custodians and wallet companies
utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain to discuss efficient use of the blockchain and
ways to engage with the open source community.

[workshop]: /workshops

Over the coming months, we plan to:

- Continue engaging with engineers from companies using the Bitcoin network and
  with the open source community. We don't claim to be the
  representative for either side, but on the whole we think the more engagement
  there is between industry and open source, the better.
- Continue producing high quality technical content in the form of weekly
  newsletters and potentially a 'scaling cookbook'.
- Hold more workshops for Bitcoin engineers to discuss real-world scaling
  issues, and feed findings back to the open source community.
- Host an online forum for Bitcoin engineers to discuss technical scaling
  issues.
- Monitor the adoption of scaling techniques and the general health of the
  Bitcoin network.

Above all, it's very important to highlight what we're *not*:

- We're not a Bitcoin foundation. We're just engineers and contributors who
  care about Bitcoin and want to see it succeed.
- We don't represent Bitcoin Core. We've all contributed to that project, but
  our work with Bitcoin Optech is project-agnostic. 
- We don't represent and are not beholden to any Bitcoin companies.
- We're not profit-driven. We're fortunate enough to have sponsorship to
  carry out our work, and are asking for modest contributions from member
  companies to cover our expenses.

If you're an engineer or manager at a Bitcoin company or an open source
contributor and you'd like to be a part of this, please contact us at

on our [web site][website].
