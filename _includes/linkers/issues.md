issues.md: creates Markdown referency-style links to issues and pull
requests in the Bitcoin Core, LND, C-Lightning, and libsecp256k1 repositories.

When changing this file, a good test to run to ensure that all links are
working is the htmlproofer line from the Makefile with the
"disable-external" parameter removed.  Beware that this can be bandwidth
intensive and that you might get throttled/banned for suspected website
scraping.

  Input:
    - issues: (CSV) the issue numbers to create links for separated by
      commas with no spaces.  For a given number, a separate link will
      be created for *all* suppored repositories

  Output:
    List of Markdown reference-style links

  Example:
    Input:
      % include linkers/issues.md issues="123,456" %
    Output
      [bitcoin core #123]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/123
      [lnd #123]: https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/123
      [bitcoin core #456]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/456
      [lnd #456]: https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/456
