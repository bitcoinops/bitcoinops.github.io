{% capture return-to-fees %}Schmidt begins his talk by
reviewing some statistics from recent Bitcoin fee events, both short
events from the past couple of months and the longer event from
January 2017 to January 2018 where the next-block fee for an
average-sized transaction was consistently over $1 (and often over
$2).  He reminds listeners that high fees are likely to return---which
may have already happened---and that organizations that implement
techniques to reduce their fees by even small percentages could save
significant amounts of money for themselves or their customers if fees
climb as high (or higher) than they did before.

  He then describes several techniques services can implement in order
  to reduce their fees, and he roughly quantifies how much improvement
  can be expected from each technique.  This includes: better fee
  estimation, better coin selection, payment batching, using segwit,
  UTXO consolidation, patient spending, Replace-by-Fee (RBF) fee
  bumping, Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) fee bumping, and Lightning
  (as a future technique).  He also notes that education plays an
  important role in getting users to accept and adopt several of these
  techniques, and points out that it can also help reduce user
  interaction costs such as providing customer support for stuck
  transactions during fee events.

  The 30-minute presentation covers each point concisely, making it an
  excellent high-level overview for anyone interested in learning
  about the Bitcoin fee market and how to mitigate expected fee
  increases.{% endcapture %}
