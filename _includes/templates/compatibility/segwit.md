## Segwit Addresses {#segwit}

**What are segwit addresses?** Transactions that spend bitcoins secured by segregated witness (segwit) use less
block weight than equivalent non-segwit (legacy) transactions, allowing
segwit transactions to pay less total fee to achieve the same feerate as legacy transactions.
