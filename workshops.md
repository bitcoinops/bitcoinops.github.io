Bitcoin Optech will run a series of workshops to bring Bitcoin engineers
together to discuss approaches and challenges in implementing scaling
technologies. Each workshop will be tailored to the member companies attending
and the specific scaling challenges that they are facing.

If you have any requests or suggestions for future workshop events, please
[contact us][optech email].

## Workshops #3 & #4 - Schnorr and Taproot Seminars {#taproot-workshop}

- San Francisco, September 24 2019
- New York, September 27 2019

*Schnorr signatures* and *Taproot* are proposed changes to the Bitcoin
protocol that promise greatly improved privacy, fungibility, scalability and
functionality. These seminar format workshops will include a mixture of
presentations, coding exercises and discussions, and will give engineers at
member companies an understanding of how these new technologies work and how
they can be applied to their products and services. They will also give
engineers an opportunity to take part in the feedback process while these
technologies are still in the proposal stage.

#### Topics

Optech will present each of the following topics, and then engineers will
get experience writing code that implements:

- [Schnorr signatures](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki)
- [MuSig](https://blockstream.com/2019/02/18/en-musig-a-new-multisignature-standard/)
- [Taproot](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-taproot.mediawiki)
- [Tapscript](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-tapscript.mediawiki)

## Workshop #2 - Paris, November 12-13 2018

Bitcoin Optech held our second roundtable workshop in Paris on November 12-13 2018.
The format was the same as the first workshop in San Francisco.

In attendence were 24 engineers from Bitcoin companies and open source
projects.

#### Topics

- Replace-by-fee vs. child-pays-for-parent as fee replacement techniques
- Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions ([BIP 174](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki))
- [Output script descriptors](https://gist.github.com/sipa/e3d23d498c430bb601c5bca83523fa82) for wallet interoperability
- Lightning wallet integration and applications for exchanges
- Approaches to coin selection & consolidation

#### Thanks

Thanks to Ledger for hosting the workshop and helping with organization.

## Workshop #1 - San Francisco, July 17 2018

Bitcoin Optech held our first roundtable workshop in San Francisco on July 17 2018:

- Topics were discussed in a roundtable format in which every participant had an
  equal opportunity to engage.

- Each topic had a moderator and notetaker. The moderator was responsible for a
  brief introduction of a topic and keeping discussion on track and on time.

- To make sure that participants were comfortable to speak freely, notes and
  action items were distributed to participants but not beyond. Participants
  were free to share discussion details internally at their companies and
  publicly, but did not attribute any particular statement to a given individual
  (Chatham House Rules).

In attendence were 14 engineers from SF Bay Area Bitcoin companies and open
source projects.

#### Topics

- Coin selection
- Fee estimation, RBF, CPFP best practices
- Optech community and communication

#### Thanks

Thanks to Square for hosting the workshop and Coinbase for helping with
organization.
