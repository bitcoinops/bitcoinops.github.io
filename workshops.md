# Format:
- Each topic will be a roundtable discussion in which every participant has an equal opportunity to engage.
- There will be a moderator and notetaker. The moderator will be responsible for a brief introduction of a topic and keeping discussion on track and on time.
- We want participants to be comfortable to speak freely, so it is intended that notes and action items taken will be distributed to participants but not beyond. Participants are free to share discussion details internally at their companies and publicly, but should refrain from attributing any particular statement to a given individual (Chatham House Rules).
