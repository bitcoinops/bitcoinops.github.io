The Bitcoin Optech scaling cookbook is a guide to effective practices and
techniques that engineers interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain can adopt
today. These practices are good for your business (they make your operations
run more efficiently and save you money) and good for the ecosystem (they minimise
your usage of common network resources and ensure that the Bitcoin network
remains available for as many users and use cases as possible).

What is it that we mean by _scaling_ when talking about the Bitcoin blockchain?
In general, we can call a system 'scalable' if the resources consumed by the
system scales no worse than linearly with the number of users or units of
activity in the system. The Bitcoin base layer as a payment network does not
appear to achieve this definition of scalability. Since the Bitcoin network
makes use of a peer-to-peer gossip protocol in which every node validates every
transaction, the global amount of computation, bandwidth and storage required
scales (in at least some senses) quadratically with the number of users. n
users validating transactions from n users results in the order of n<sup>2</sup>
validations. Even if we radically reduce the security by requiring new users to
be 'light clients' and not validate the full state of the system, adding new
users by increasing the transaction throughput is still at best linear in total
global resource cost.

And there's another problem. In many systems, the costs of the additional
resources consumed is borne by the party benefiting from the additional
activity. If a company needs to acquire additional computing resource to serve
new customers, then that company would pay for the additional servers or cloud
computing resources and benefit from the increased revenue generated by the
customers. That isn't the case with on-chain Bitcoin transactions. Each full
node operator bears the resource costs of validating transactions, in the form
of bandwidth, compute, memory and storage. Naively increasing the transaction
throughput of the Bitcoin network would therefore benefit parties creating additional
transactions at the expense of everyone running a full node. Many users
recognise that a vital component of maintaining a decentralized network is keeping
the cost of running a full node low and allowing as many users as possible to
run a full node. An attempt in 2017 to double the block size (and hence increase
the resource requirements of running a full node), failed to gain consensus and
was [withdrawn by its proponents][segwit2x].

So if scaling up the underlying resource requirements is not currently an
option (and in any case could not deliver the global scale that Bitcoin
proponents would like to see), scaling Bitcoin becomes a question of
how to maximize the utility that can be delivered _within the constraints_ of
the system, or in other words, how we can achieve _more with less_?

The utility that the Bitcoin blockchain delivers is _payments_, since that’s
what users want to use the Bitcoin system for. To confuse the logical concept
of a Bitcoin _transaction_ with the social concept of a payment is a
conspicuous (and sadly very common) error. A _payment_ is a transfer of value
from one party to another. In Bitcoin, a _transaction_ is a transformation on
the global set of unspent transaction outputs, consuming some UTXOs and
producing some new UTXOs.  _Transaction_ can also refer to a data structure
that is passed over the P2P network that both describes the transformation on
the UTXO set and carries a witness that the transformation is valid. In neither
of these definitions does a transaction correspond to a payment - each
transaction can realize one, many or even no payments.

To try to measure scalability with a metric like _transactions per second_
(_tps_) is therefore flawed. Firstly, _tps_ is not measuring what we’re
interested in, and secondly, not all payments are equally useful.

To give a concrete Example of the first point, if high-frequency Bitcoin users
switched from sending many single-recipient transactions per day to sending a
single batched transaction per day, the average blockchain weight per _payment_
would decrease, but the average blockchain weight per _transaction_ would
increase.  We'd very likely see a Bitcoin network with fewer transactions per
day, but a greater number of payments. Utility is up, but _tps_ is down!

The second reason is that not all transactions are equally useful. Since each
transaction is simply a transformation on the set of UTXOs, the Bitcoin
consensus rules do not recognise any difference in importance between different
transactions. The transaction produced by an institutional investor moving
hundreds of Bitcoin into a cold storage multisig output as part of a long-term
investment strategy could look identical to the transaction for a customer
paying for a cup of coffee. Each counts as one 'transaction' but the first user
probably gets much more utility from his transaction than the second user. The
former may be prepared to pay a high fee to have his transaction recorded in a
decentralized, trustless, immutable ledger, whereas the latter may be equally
satisfied to have his payment made on a second-layer like lightning, a
side-chain or even a trusted off-chain payment network.

The Bitcoin network has a mechanism for users to express the urgency and
utility of their transactions through transaction fees, but at the time of
writing, the fee market is underdeveloped, inelastic and immature. As the network
develops, it is expected that the fee market will become more sophisticated.

When considered in this light, many practices which might not at first be
considered as 'scaling technologies' can be considered as such. For example, a
functioning fee market, and above all a reliable way to 'bump' fees on a
transaction that has not yet included in a block, allows users to better
express their time preference for a transaction to be confirmed. That means
that the scarce block space can be allocated more efficiently to those users
who value it more, and therefore the total utility delivered by the network is
increased. This book takes this wider view of 'scalability'. Any technique that
can increase the usefulness of the network in aggregate can be thought of as
contributing to scaling.

Take this book then as a guide to extracting the most possible value out of
this scarce and precious resource called the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol
wizards continue to innovate on the base and second layers, and exciting
developments like Schnorr signatures, taproot, signature aggregation, eltoo,
atomic multi path payments and channel splicing are all in the works. But for
now, we can all do our bit to minimize our impact on the base layer and allow
as many users as possible to transact permissionlessly and trustlessly.

# About Bitcoin Optech

Bitcoin Optech was formed in early 2018. Our aim is to help Bitcoin companies
adopt the best scaling technologies and practices available to make efficient
use of the blockchain, and thereby help Bitcoin to scale to more users and use
cases.

During late 2017 and early 2018, we saw demand for Bitcoin usage explode and
many users and companies were unready for the sudden spike in transaction
volume. Block space suddenly became a competitive a rivalrous good, and
transaction fees jumped as demand exceeded supply.

At the same time, many well-understood scaling technologies were being
underutilized. Segwit usage remained below 40%, some high-frequency users
of the chain were sending payments as individual transactions rather than
batching, fee estimates were failing to react to fee market conditions and
poor coin selection led to wallets accumulating low value UTXOs and paying
very high fees.

The end result was a poor and costly experience for users, some use cases
being priced out entirely, and Bitcoin failing to scale to meet demand. At
Bitcoin Optech, we believe that seawalls are best built during low tide, and
hope that Bitcoin companies will take advantage of conditions of low network
usage and transaction fees to implement these scaling techniques. Those
that do will be best positioned to continue offering their customers the
best reliability and value when Bitcoin usage surges again.

# Intended Audience

This book is intended for engineers who work in developer or operational roles
at companies that interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. It is meant as a
practical guide for people who are already familiar with standard Bitcoin
concepts like ScriptPubKeys, ScriptSigs and witnesses; the SCRIPT language and
standard output types; public and private keys; and transaction serialization.
See [Mastering Bitcoin][antonopoulos] or [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency
Technologies][narayanan] for a beginners guide to those concepts or
[btcinformation.org][] for a comprehensive reference.

Likewise, this book is not overly concerned with the cryptographic
underpinnings of Bitcoin, except where those are directly required for
improving the efficiency and scalability of Bitcoin operations. Cryptography is
a fascinating subject and [Dan Boneh's Applied Cryptography course][boneh] is
an excellent introduction for those wishing to begin their exploration.

# Conventions

Most terms are used as readers would expect. The script in a transaction output
which encumers the output is the scriptPubKey. The script in the transaction
input which unlocks the funds is the scriptSig. The *scriptCode* is the
actually executed script (which is the redeemscript in non-segwit P2SH, and the
witnesscript in P2WSH/P2WPKH).

The smallest unit of account is referred to as a satoshi by convention, and
10^8 satoshis is named a bitcoin. No other units of account are used.

The party making a payment is called the _spender_ (_sender_ could be
ambiguously refer to a party sending Bitcoin or a party sending data). There is
no equivalent word in English to disambiguate the receiver of a payment and
the receiver of data, so we use the word _recipient_ to refer to one receiving
a payment, and live with the ambiguity.

## Transaction weight and virtual bytes

The consensus rule for block size is that the combined _weight_ of
transactions must be less than 4,000,000. The weight of a single
transaction is calculated as follows:

- The _base size_ of a transaction is the number of bytes to serialize the
  block without witness
- The _size_ of a transaction is the number of bytes to serialize the block
  with witness
- The _weight_ is 3 x base size + size

This formula means that the bytes in the witness are 'discounted' by a factor
of 4. They count less towards the weight of the transaction than bytes in
the base transaction.

The _virtual size_ of a transaction is weight / 4 and is measured in _virtual bytes_
or _vBytes_. For transactions without any segwit inputs, the base size, size and
virtual size are all equal.
