Covenants are constraints the receiver of bitcoins places on their
ability to spend those bitcoins to the next receiver.  For example,
Alice can use a covenant to only allow her hot wallet to send her
bitcoins to either her cold wallet or her favorite exchange.

- [Applications][] are ideas for enhancing efficiency, privacy, or both
  using covenants

- [Proposals][] are ideas for changing Bitcoin's rules to enable
  covenant-based applications (or to make existing applications more
  powerful)

- [Analysis][] draws insights from the data available on individual
  applications and proposals.
