Covenants are constraints the receiver of bitcoins places on their
ability to spend those bitcoins to the next receiver.  For example,
Alice can use a covenant to only allow her hot wallet to send her
bitcoins to either her cold wallet or her favorite exchange.

- [Uses][] are ideas for enhancing efficiency, privacy, or both
  using covenants

- [Proposals][] are ideas for changing Bitcoin's protocol rules to
  enable new uses for Bitcoin (or to make existing uses simpler or more
  powerful)

- [Analysis][] draws insights from the data available on individual
  proposals and uses.
