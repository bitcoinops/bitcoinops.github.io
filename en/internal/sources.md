# Sources for the Optech Newsletter

The _News_ section of the newsletter is currently sourced from the
following discussion groups:

- [Bitcoin-Dev][] mailing list
- [DLC-Dev][] mailing list
- [Mining-Dev][] mailing list
- [#bitcoin-core-dev][] IRC
- [#lightning-dev][] IRC
- [Bitcoin Transcripts][]
- [Protocol Design][] and [Implementation][] categories on the [DelvingBitcoin][] web forum

We will include urgent and important news, such as security
announcements, from any source.  Otherwise, we normally will not write
about any subject unless it has recently been discussed in one of the
above sources.

Other parts of the newsletter are based on other sources.  In most
cases, this is made clear by the section title or by the text
introducing the section; for example, the monthly "Bitcoin Core PR
Review Club Summary" and "Bitcoin Stack Exchange" sections.

## Motivation for only using a few news sources

Ideas for changes to Bitcoin need to be peer reviewed---that way bad
ideas can be clearly rejected and good ideas can attract people who will
put them into practice.  But effective peer review is harder the more
discussion becomes spread out across multiple groups.  Alice might not
be in the same group as Bob, preventing her from seeing his idea.  Or,
even if she does see it, she may not be able to easily respond to it.

Of course, not everyone is interested in every subject, so any
particular group can only scale up to handling a certain variety of
topics.  After that, it's natural for it to segment into different
groups, just as LN and DLCs are now often discussed separately from
Bitcoin in general.

But, when possible, Optech prefers to only track one discussion group
per subject.  We do this to encourage anyone who wants to see their
topic appear in Optech to discuss it in the place where it's most likely
to be seen by their peers.  If your idea is important or interesting
enough to earn the attention of your peers, then it's probably important
or interesting enough for Optech to write about.

Additionally, only having a short list of sources to check for
news makes writing the newsletter each week much more manageable.  It's
possible for us to read every post to a small or mid-sized discussion
group.  It's not possible for us to read everything about Bitcoin on
large social media sites or hundreds of individual blogs.
