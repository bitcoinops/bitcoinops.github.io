        Sending Transaction - Opendime does not have traditional wallet
        capabilities. You can either sweep the private key to use in a regular
        wallet or use the balance.py script to send all funds to an address.

        Sending Transaction - There is a balance.py python script which can send a transaction using pycoin but does not specify RBF when creating a transaction.

        Receiving Transaction Signaling RBF - Opendime uses a simple address explorer on opendime.com. No RBF Flag. OPENDIMEâ€™s simple transaction list explorer does not provide RBF flag notice. However there are links to other explorers on the page (Blockchain.info, Blocktrail, LocalBitcoins, BitInfoCharts, a BIP122 link).

        Receiving Replacement Transaction - Transaction list screen when a transaction has been replaced. Bottom transaction is the replacement transaction. Original transaction does not show up in list anymore.
