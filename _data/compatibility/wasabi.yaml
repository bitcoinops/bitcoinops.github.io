        sent transaction. No RBF bump options. Transaction not sent signaling
        RBF. While Wasabi does not support manual sending RBF signaling transactions,
        if a transaction replacement is done using the same seed in a different
        wallet, Wasabi shows only the replacement transaction in the transaction
        list.
