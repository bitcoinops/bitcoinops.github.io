        Coinbase does not have an explicit option for receiving to bech32.
        Coinbase uses p2sh wrapped segwit addresses for receiving.

      caption: >
        Coinbase allows sending to either wrapped or native segwit addresses.
        There is also visual validation of the address format.

      caption: >
        Transaction details screen shows the bech32 address. However, the link
        for that address uses a block explorer (BlockCypher) which shows an
        error as it does not support bech32 addresses.
    - image: /img/compatibility/coinbase/segwit/change-address.png
      caption: >
        Coinbase uses bech32 for their change addresses, even when the send is
        going to non bech32.

    #  caption: >
    #    Coinbase allows for sending to bech32 including P2WPKH and P2WSH for
    #    segwit v0. Coinbase detects segwit v1 addresses and displays a
    #    validation error.
