        BitGo's web wallet UI defaults to P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses.
        Visually, the segwit logo is displayed next to segwit addresses with a
        toolip indicating "Wrapped Segwit". While bech32 receive addresses are 
        not possible in the UI currently, bech32 receive addresses can be generated using the API.
