      "The terrible thing about a consensus system like Bitcoin is that every on-chain action we perform affects every other user of the system. That makes all of us neighbors, so we're faced with the choice of either being the bad neighbors who complain endlessly about each other or the good neighbors who work together to solve problems and find ways to coexist in harmony."

      "As a developer, it feels like Bitcoin development innovates far too quickly for anyone to keep up! But engineering isn't enough to translate technological advancement into tangible improvements in a real person's life. Optech has been an incredible resource throughout my journey; I hope to help it be the same for the thousands of builders, designers, educators and trailblazers we'll need to bring Bitcoin to a billion people."

      "In an ever-changing world, the Bitcoin revolution represents a pivotal movement combining financial and social shifts. Recognizing the need to understand this, I've translated bitcoinops.org newsletters into French to democratize access to key developments. My aim is to enable broader participation in shaping the future. Proud to join esteemed contributors, I echo Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's sentiment: 'As for the future, it's not about predicting it, but making it possible.'"

      "If you believe fixing the money can fix the world, you cannot ignore Bitcoin. If you want to understand Bitcoin, you cannot ignore Optech. Since I made it my routine going through every word of every week's newsletter, my understanding of what Bitcoin was, is and where it might be going took a big leap forward. I am happy to make the knowledge accessible to more people and thus move us a bit closer to fixing the world."
