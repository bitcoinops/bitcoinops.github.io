      "I started Optech because if Bitcoin is to be successful, then one of the fundamental challenges facing Bitcoin services and businesses will be how to maximize customer utility by making efficient use of the blockchain. Helping Bitcoin ecosystem players adopt scaling techniques and technologies is one of the most effective ways we can help Bitcoin scale today."

      "The terrible thing about a consensus system like Bitcoin is that every on-chain action we perform affects every other user of the system. That makes all of us neighbors, so we're faced with the choice of either being the bad neighbors who complain endlessly about each other or the good neighbors who work together to solve problems and find ways to coexist in harmony."

      "New Bitcoin technologies, and more importantly, their rationales will always take some time to propagate from the engineers working on the bleeding-edge to the services and businesses focused on serving their customers. I'm honored to be able to help Optech accelerate this process."

      "As a developer, it feels like Bitcoin development innovates far too quickly for anyone to keep up! But engineering isn't enough to translate technological advancement into tangible improvements in a real person's life. Optech has been an incredible resource throughout my journey; I hope to help it be the same for the thousands of builders, designers, educators and trailblazers we'll need to bring Bitcoin to a billion people."
